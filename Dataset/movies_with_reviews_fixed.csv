1,Toy Story (1995),Animation|Children's|Comedy,"This movie came out when I was three. Now I'm twenty seven and the goddamn thing still holds up.  _Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._ Decided to revisit this after many years and still holds up so well. Great movie for both kids and adults with wonderful teachable moments. Just a groundbreaking animated movie all around. **4.5/5** A stunning feature film entrance from Pixar! <em>'Toy Story'</em> is a true delight, from the first second to the last.  The CGI animation is excellent. All the toys look brilliant, as does the world itself - I love the feel of it. The music is very good, Randy Newman does a nice job - ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" is a cracker.  Tom Hanks leads a strong cast. Hanks plays Woody, to fantastic effect. He is the best part of this film. Tim Allen is great, too, as Buzz Lightyear. Don Rickles (Mr. Potato Head), Wallace Shawn (Rex) and John Ratzenberger (Hamm) also bring fun.  Everything else is just as terrific: the humour, the pa",5
2,Jumanji (1995),Adventure|Children's|Fantasy,"Throw the dice and take a turn, Jumanji made the critics gurn.  Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and based on Chris Van Allsburg's short story of the same name. It stars Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Jonathan Hyde. The story is about a weird board game that when played unleashes hazards from the jungle with every throw of the dice. Once you have started playing you have to finish the game for normality to be resumed.  Simple in plot and coming off as an excuse to show off some impressive effects -said the critics - Jumanji defied the critics of the time to become a box office winner and a family favourite. Enough of a favourite to spawn a sequel (Zathura 2005), an animated TV series and a board game. In truth the film is reliant on the effects to entertain, with the cast (all competent and enjoyable) merely lurching from one perilous throw of the dice to another. But to call the film shallow is wrong and ignorant. There's flecks of bad parenting,",2

6,Heat (1995),Action|Crime|Thriller,"You don't live with me, you live among the remains of dead people.  Heat is written and directed by Michael Mann. It stars Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Diane Venora, Ashley Judd, Amy Brennerman and Danny Trejo. Music is scored by Elliot Goldenthal and cinematography by Dante Spinoti.  Big time thief Neil McCauley (DeNiro) is after one last major score before he retires, but hot on his tail is Vincent Hannah (Pacino), a cop equally and methodically as driven as he is himself.  In the build up to Heat's release, much was made of it being the first on screen pairing of DeNiro and Pacino. A mouthwatering prospect for sure, it proved to be worth the wait and unfolds as a lesson in restrained acting with two modern greats affording each other the respect that was due. What we didn't realise in the build up to the film's release, was that it would prove to be one of the greatest cops and robbers movies of all time, brought to us by an auteur director w",5
7,Sabrina (1995),Comedy|Romance,"**A completely dispensable remake, for many of the qualities it may have, and which it does!**  Firstly, allow me to say that I am not one of those who think that there can or should be untouchable films, which due to their value or relevance should never be subject to revisits or remakes. “Sabrina”, the original film starring Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart, is a renowned classic and its place will never be in question. However, after seeing this modern remake, I can't help but feel that it was unnecessary. Despite being a good film, it can't be better than the original, it isn't the slightest bit different, and it wasn't able to update the original story. I really don't know where Sidney Pollack was able to think this was a good idea.  The story of this film, as well as a large amount of the dialogue, are copied from the original onto carbon paper, with almost no essential modifications. In fact, the most striking phrases of the dialogues are all there, the situations are the ",1
8,Tom and Huck (1995),Adventure|Children's,"Good enough.  It doesn't come close to Disney's other film from the 1990s featuring Mark Twain's Huckleberry, <em>'The Adventures of Huck Finn'</em>. In fairness, this one is more about Tom Sawyer than Huck, which is pleasing given they already portrayed Huck just two years prior.  The actor who depicts the latterly named character is Brad Renfro, who isn't all that to be truthful; he's fine, just not memorable at all. Jonathan Taylor Thomas, meanwhile, plays Tom and he is, probably, the best part of this production. He's cheekiness works well for the role. Elsewhere, Eric Schweig (Injun Joe) makes for a decent bad guy.  I like the vibe of <em>'Tom and Huck'</em>, I think it could've done without the love story but that doesn't hamper things much. I would say the film goes at a slower pace than I would prefer, it particularly drags ever so slightly towards the end. Still, I rate it... mostly thanks to Mr. Thomas. **A (much) smaller production from the Disney repertoire that every",2

10,GoldenEye (1995),Action|Adventure|Thriller,"Really solid entry into the series with Brosnan, who is personally my favorite Bond, is great. The plot is on the thin side but is helped having Sean Bean as the sinister villain and of course Famke Janssen makes for an amazingly sexy psychopath with, ahem, incredible thighs. **4.0/5** _**The Russia installment, plus Pierce Brosnan’s debut**_  Agent 007 (Pierce Brosnan) returns to Russia to investigate the theft of a space-based electromagnetic pulse weapon, which destroyed a radar facility in Siberia with only one survivor (Izabella Scorupco). Sean Bean plays an MI6 agent, Famke Janssen a ruthless assassin, Gottfried John a Russian commander, Joe Don Baker a CIA contact in St. Petersburg and Judi Dench the new ‘M.’  ""Goldeneye"" (1995) introduces Brosnan for his four-film stint in the series and he does a fine job as James Bond. Some people write him off as a “pretty boy” but, while he’s a handsome man, he’s also masculine and kick-axx. He’s perfect for the role.  While the plot ",5

12,Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995),Comedy|Horror,"Most probably my least favourite film, both of Mel Brooks (though I haven't seen 'Life Stinks' yet) and of Leslie Nielsen (though I refuse to watch any other of the post-'Airplane' and 'Naked Gun' knockoffs he's made over the years since), but it still doesn't deserve all the hate. It's STILL at least 50,000 times funnier than Lena Dunham's 'Tiny Furniture' (or about 70% of the so-called contemporary American comedies made these days). **Nielsen has done better, but this movie is good enough to be enjoyable and mildly funny.**  This comedy, starring Leslie Nielsen and intelligently directed by Mel Brooks, is truly good. It is a parody of old horror movies, in which Dracula is an aristocratic undead who lives off the blood of unsuspecting humans. The film is more directly inspired by the old productions of Hammer Studios and Francis Ford Coppola's _Dracula_, which was still recent when the film was released. The script is, therefore, similar in every way to the last film I mentioned.",3
13,Balto (1995),Animation|Children's,"Balto is an a underrated treasure with memorable characters, endearing moments, howling humor, and canine villainy/heroism that rivals movies from Disney's golden-age.  You'll be rooting for the literal underdog throughout while all of the supporting characters add to the charm.  It's a top-tier family movie that has zero foul language and zero religious slurs, with the only near-miss being when one character says ""Son of a..."", leaving the phrase unfinished.  If you like a good sled-dog movie, this is one of the best!",1
14,Nixon (1995),Drama,"Wow, this was a pretty fair movie wasn't it? And it came from Oliver Stone. One would almost expect it to be a paranoid mess, but it was done pretty well.  Hopkins did a great job too... except maybe looking a little too old for the role, but he captured a lot of Nixon's mannerisms, a lot of how he spoke and moved. It was far from uncanny, but he really did nail the essence of the character and that is almost better than cloning him.  Joan Allen fails though. She doesn't exactly ape Pat as well as she could and you are left with the impression that she doesn't understand who she was depicting.  And then you have little hints at the Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories and, even though I supported them, I don't think that they had a place in a movie about Nixon. They felt alien and X-Files and you are left doubting that said conversation ever took place.  Aside from all of that, though, this seems like a great film that was fairly done, about someone that it would have been",1
15,Cutthroat Island (1995),Action|Adventure|Romance,"Not as bad as it's notoriously condemned as being, but still clearly shows that both leads and the director were ill-advised (you know very well that if you were getting Harlin at that point in time, you were getting Davis--that's exactly why she probably married him). She brings her A-game and definitely tries her best but this just isn't her thing, and Modine's clearly not blockbuster star material for action films. A few of Harlin's set-pieces worked particularly well, but he pandered too much for his wife. That can work if you're, say, the Rossellinis and you're filming a drama set in Italy, but it's not working here, though I'll adore Davis to my dying day. I will add that this is my 13 year-old son's favourite films. Very curious if they would have made sequels had it not bombed--the ending sure was open-ended enough to give off that impression.  This is one film that if you just sit back and enjoy the ride will offer you a guilty pleasure. Definitely worth a watch if you enjoy",4
16,Casino (1995),Drama|Thriller,"Sharon Stone and Robert De Niro were amazing! Robert De Niro is my favorite actor! How he was talking about <a href=""http://www.arrabitah.org/"">pokerstar bonus code</a> and smile at that moment! He was perfect. Now, it is one of my favorite movies. You have to see it! You will not regret it. I promise You know, I think this might be my favourite Scorsese movie. He re-assembles his regular cast, adds a soupçon of Sharon Stone and proceeds to make three hours of cinema fly by. It all centres around the aspirational ""Sam Rothstein"" (Robert De Niro) who realises that there is a great deal of money to be made in Las Vegas in the 1970s. To that end, he is sent by his mafia bosses to run the ""Tangiers"" casino, hotel and general den of iniquity. Initially, though ruthless enough, he has a degree of decency to him, and when he falls in love with hustler ""Ginger"" (Sharon Stone) things seem to suggest that maybe he could be destined for the straight(-ish) and narrow. The same can not be said for",2
17,Sense and Sensibility (1995),Drama|Romance,"The briefest of cameos from Tim Wilkinson informs us that due to inheritance rules, the second “Mrs. Dashwood” (Gemma Jones) and her daughters are going to be at the mercy of his son upon his demise. That fellow (James Fleet) is actually quite a kindly soul, but his rather more mercenary wife “Fanny” (Harriet Walter) reckons they can be left to get by with just their annuity of £500. With daughters “Elinor” (Emma Thompson); “Marianne” (Kate Winslet) and “Margaret” (Emilie François) to keep, that’s going to be quite a task. Luckily, widower distant cousin “Sir John” (Robert Hardy) and his lively mother-in-law (Elizabeth Spriggs) invite them to lodge in a well-appointed cottage on their estate. That’s where the family settle and each of the girls gradually becomes embroiled in romance. For “Elinor” it’s the dashing but shy “Ferrars” (Hugh Grant) who takes her fancy. Talking of dashing, there’s also the charming “Col. Brandon” (Alan Rickman) who is keen on young “Marianne” - but her atten",1

19,Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995),Comedy,"Not any where as good as the 1st. It was ok. Not as funny. I guess I just didn't like the whole jungle theme. **Uninteresting, the film is only not worse thanks to Jim Carrey.**  Personally, I liked the first movie. Jim Carrey is a force of nature and almost always manages to surprise us with his crazy things. Unfortunately, this film is inferior, much inferior, and in good part due to the poor level of comedy, which abuses sexual and scatological humor to make jokes, increasingly predictable and unfunny.  I really think that the film's problem is in the script, a piece of garbage that shouldn't have been used for anything other than a good bonfire. Another problem is the departure of Tom Shadyac and the replacement by Steve Oedekerk, a director who is incapable of having the same creativity and comic spirit. These two problems doomed the film.  Jim Carrey turns out to be the least guilty. He continues to be a huge actor and carries the entire film on his shoulders with a panache",2
20,Money Train (1995),Action,"**Money Train loses interest while trying to figure out what it wants to be.**  Money Train is a movie with an identity crisis. Is it a buddy cop movie? Crime drama? Serial killer char? Heist film? Romance piece? Well, Money Train tries to be all those things in less than 2 hours, making for a disjointed mess with inconsistent pacing and barely any story to follow. Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes are the good guys of the story, but they ultimately rob a train and cause millions of dollars of damage, and the audience is supposed to laugh it off because their boss is a jerk. Doesn’t work. With a cast including Wesley Snipes, Woody Harrelson, and Jennifer Lopez, I thought Money Train had to be at least mildly entertaining (and it did have fun moments), but the numerous stories and tones left everything too underdeveloped to enjoy and an ending that is more abrupt than satisfying.",1
21,Get Shorty (1995),Action|Comedy|Drama,"I know that no movie is perfect but for my money Get Shorty is on my short list of films that come close. As good as the book is, I believe the movie improved upon it.  I have watched it a few times, it being one of those movies we might invite a friend over to watch who hasn’t seen it. Plus it has surfaced a few times when I surf streaming channels and I usually stop to watch for a while, no matter where in the film I am.  The ensemble cast (which includes a few lower echelon stars) is excellent and mostly look like they are having fun with it. There is violence, but not with buckets of blood. It almost seems like cartoonish violence. And of course wit and humor run through it, with a bit of satire on Hollywood thrown in.  I just found out today that a sequel was made called Be Cool and a British tv series based on the book, but I like this one so much I won't even risk disappointment by watching those other entries. You know what, I really love Elmore Leonard, and a part of me fe",3
22,Copycat (1995),Crime|Drama|Thriller,"Sigourney Weaver is ""Helen"", a psychologist who has a major panic attack if she has to leave her apartment to fetch a newspaper from the corridor outside! She is, however an expert on what drives serial killers - having had a pretty near death experience with one earlier in her career - Harry Connick Jnr, no less. When a copycat starts to kill young women, she is drafted in by police officers ""Monahan"" (Holly Hunter) and her partner ""Goetz"" (Dermot Mulroney) and together they have to track down this masochistic individual before he strikes again. To make things more interesting, the killer starts to get in touch with them, to tease and goad them - he even gives them a name - but can they apprehend him before his spree continues unabated? It's an OK crime drama this, no better really. The cast work well enough, but the plot is riddled with holes that rather rob the thing of much jeopardy and provide for an ending that you can see from space. Sigourney Weaver does enough, and Hunter make",1
23,Assassins (1995),Thriller,"Check Mate?  Sly Stallone stars as an ageing assassin who gets embroiled in a cat and mouse game with a younger assassin who wants to be number one of the trade. Teaming up with a computer hacker, Stallone battles not only his pursuer but also an event from his past that troubles him so.  With Antonio Banderas and Julianne Moore in starry support, Richard Donner in the director's chair and the Wachowski brothers on writing duties, Assassins held the promise of a top line actioner. Sadly that promise is not met.  There's clear signs of the makers trying to make something more deep and cerebral, what ultimately transpires is a overly complicated - and way over long - picture. Punctured with great action scenes, none more so than an outrageous taxi ride that John Woo would be proud of, it's in the middle section where pic drags itself into needless slumber. By this mid-point, one has had enough of Banderas, who comes off more like a deranged excitable kid than someone to be feared. ",2
24,Powder (1995),Drama|Sci-Fi,"_**""Can't imagine there's meanness; can't imagine one lie""**_    ""Powder"" was the first of two films that came out in 1995-1996 dealing with a gifted individual who is super-smart and has paranormal powers; the second was ""Phenomenon"" with John Travolta. ""Powder"" is the superior. While ""Phenomenon"" is good, ""Powder"" reaches for greatness and, in some ways, achieves it, even while it’s marred by a few dubious moments.  Sean Patrick Flanery plays a hairless albino teen in East Texas, nicknamed Powder, who's discovered living in a basement after his grandfather's sudden death. As a ward of the state, he is placed in a boy's school where his uniqueness stirs up trouble.  For a film like this to work you have to buy into the character, and this is one of the movie's strengths. Flanery reveals his acting expertise in his convincing portrayal of the shy, gifted teen. Flannery's Powder stands strong with the greatest misfits in cinema, like Nimoy's Spock and Hank's Forrest Gump.  Actua",1
25,Leaving Las Vegas (1995),Drama|Romance,"_**Cage terminally drunk in Las Vegas with Elisabeth Shue and lots of jazz/blues**_  An alcoholic in Los Angeles (Nicolas Cage) cashes out of the film industry and moves to Las Vegas to apparently drink himself to death. He meets a prostitute (Elisabeth Shue) with whom he has a welcome affinity and they develop a relationship of radical acceptance.  ""Leaving Las Vegas"" (1995) is one of those downbeat realistic dramas about lost souls in hopeless dissolution. It’s well-done for what it is and Shue’s beauty is effectively showcased despite the unappealing nature of her profession. And I understand the message of “loving” acceptance with no questions. Although it could be argued that true love refuses to enable people to destroy themselves and holds them accountable to some reasonable degree.    A guy who was my best friend 20 years ago developed an alcohol problem that became increasingly glaring. He died recently, but I didn’t see him for the last four years of his life because I ",3

27,Now and Then (1995),Drama,"**A film with some charm and lack of originality, but which works well as a family film, and which deserves to be brought back from oblivion.**  This production from the 90s, currently somewhat forgotten, is another film without any bones that we can watch with our grandmothers and our children by our side, and which deserves to be revisited and cherished. I can understand why it fell into the deepest forgotten films: it's not a remarkable production, it's not one of those films that leaves a mark on us for life. However, it does its job impeccably.  The story is quite nice, even if it has nothing original: four friends meet again many years after having separated to pursue their lives, and the bond of friendship that has united them since childhood is reinforced by the reunion, full of nostalgia and good memories. There are lots of films about situations like this, and with similar themes, this is not new, but it is well done.  The film has four good adult actresses (Demi Moore,",1
28,Persuasion (1995),Romance,"I recently watched this production of Jane Austen’s Persuasion after not seeing it for many years.  It is not the best version in my opinion, but it was well worth watching. Like most British productions of this sort, it depends upon a talented ensemble cast rather than a few superstars as top billing.  It has also been a long time since I have read Jane Austen’s that this movie is based upon, and after seeing how this and two other versions stray from each other’s, in small ways that is, I would be curious to know how often each one remains true to the original. But that is not necessary to enjoy this well made production; it merely makes we wish I could take my favorite parts from all three versions to create a new whole. Failing that, I will merely say that this production, as with the others, should be acceptable to Jane Austen lovers who aren’t mortified by the least changes to her books.  I don’t know how easy it might be to track down this movie. As I understand it, it was o",1
29,"City of Lost Children, The (1995)",Adventure|Sci-Fi,"**A visual spectacle with an irritating story that doesn't justify the time spent watching the film.**  I loved – like almost everyone else – “Amelie” and I didn't particularly like “Delicatessen”. However, I didn't give up on Jean Pierre Jeunet and decided to see this film. I confess that I was impressed by the visual quality, but this is practically a trademark of the director, who seems to have a particular predilection for the color green (it was quite evident in Amelie, and in this film it was once again the dominant color of the chromatic palette). However, it returns to being, as “Delicatessen” had been, a rather strange, depressing and bizarre film. More bizarre than some Tim Burton movies, which isn't easy.  In view of what has been described above, I think it will not be surprising if I say that it is a film that is basically based on visual and special resources. There's immense visual effort here, and there's no doubt that Jeunet is behind it. The cinematography is very",2

31,Dangerous Minds (1995),Drama,"This would have only been ordinary because it's simply adequately directed, has an entire cast of unknowns save for the star, and is from a cliché-riddled script, but this is honestly one of Michelle Pfeiffer's more interesting performances. While she's not entirely convincing as a career-Marine, she's certainly more so than Demi Moore, who tried the stunt not long afterwards, and she's certainly believable as a caring teacher. An intriguing film for Simpson and Bruckheimer to be associated with, this was back in the day, after her career-defining 'Catwoman' role in 'Batman Returns' that she was still getting great starring roles (I greatly look forward to checking her out opposite Daniel Day-Lewis in 'The Age of Innocence'). My favourite work of hers will always be in 'Scarface', but this is right up there IMHO--some really fine acting by her.

Really well done by director Terry Gilliam that has great pacing through the two hour running time. **4.0/5** **_A-man-comes-back-from-the-future Sci-Fi with Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt_**  In 2035 survivors are living underground after a viral outbreak has wiped out most of the populace.

34,Babe (1995),Children's|Comedy|Drama,"Truly disgusting type of entertainment that inspires vegetarianism! It also has a scene too much to be in a children’s film that reflects on domestic violence (between two dogs). The producers who made this sort of junk were obviously nuts in the head to put such a scene like this into such family oriented film. Please do not watch after seeing this review. You do not especially want to get inspired by such propaganda about using certain animals as food. **Absolutely wonderful, and suitable for the whole family.**  Usually, people look at this movie as just another movie for kids. This is not my opinion. It is true that it is a fantasy film, with animals that talk and have human postures and behavior.

39,Clueless (1995),Comedy|Romance,"**One of the best teen movies ever.**  Teen movies can really be a terrible plague. I've had other occasions where I didn't spare them criticism, and generally it's a style of cinema that I dislike a lot for its sheer stupidity. However, this comedy about a group of spoiled rich girls is a positive example, a film for teenagers that manages to have quality and grace, while being a satire, quite critical, on the materialism and consumerism of elite teenagers.  Amy Heckerling had a brilliant idea to make a modern adaptation of the novel “Emma”, by Jane Austen. Any and all of the author's material is guaranteed to be good, and if it is well used, it usually gives good results. And indeed, the essence of this book is here: a spoiled and superficial girl who learns more about life, finds true love and the most genuine kindness and altruism. This is the transformation we see in Cher, the blonde and exuberant heroine of this film. She lives with her father, a lawyer who doesn't seem to pa",3

41,Richard III (1995),Drama|War,"Co-writers Ian McKellen and Richard Loncraine (who also directs) set their Richard III in 1930s Britain, and make the infamous hunchback a fascist warmonger plotting to usurp the throne. Today's English monarchy is, at best, nominal, but even way back in the 1930s there wasn't much to be gained by usurping it.  Then again, the film takes place in an alternate reality where the War of the Roses occurs 450 years after the true historical conflict did. I don’t mind so much that royalty has endured those four centuries and a half; what does bother me is that language has not evolved in the interim at the same rate as, say, warfare. Why on Earth would Richard (McKellen), who is neither dumb nor crazy, use the expression “my kingdom for a horse” when he could be asking for a tank instead?  This line is only in the movie because it’s in the play – but then, a great many things that are in the play aren’t in the film, and viceversa, so why keep this particular bit?

Now the king has a reputation as a bit of a Lothario, so he decides to get his favourite physician to marry one of his mistresses so as to turn the heat down a little.

44,Mortal Kombat (1995),Action|Adventure,"Mortal Kombat was one of the most popular, and controversial video games of the 90s, so naturally, in 1995, New Line Cinema released a live- action film adaptation. When the film was being advertised, several people were either excited for it, or skeptical due to Street Fighter being a total stinker, and since the film was rated PG-13, which meant the violence and gore from the game had to be toned down to appeal to the then-young MK fan base. Thankfully, all expectations were surpassed as Mortal Kombat actually turned out to be, believe it or not, a good video game movie. Upon its release, the film was, surprisingly, a box- office success, making it the first video game adaptation to be successful both financially, and with fans, despite mixed reviews from critics (although Gene Siskel gave the movie a thumbs up).

Kidman plays Suzanne, a none-to-bright woman who decides she wants to be a giant media personality. She marries Larry (Matt Dillon), a restaurateur, and settles for doing the weather at a dead-end television station. Suzanne sees that Larry is not behind her career, and uses a trio of teens to kill him. She begins her plan by befriending them while shooting a documentary, then begins sleeping with James (Joaquin Phoenix), who in turn conspires with Russell (Casey Affleck) and Lydia (Alison Folland). Most of the film is told in flashback by the killers and families of Suzanne and Larry, and Suzanne herself.  ""To Die For"" is a strange film. Acting wise, the professional cast is saddled with one-note characters. While top-heavy with supporting players, Suzanne never really changes much, or offers enough menace to feel anything for h",3

48,Pocahontas (1995),Animation|Children's|Musical|Romance,"Good offering from Disney.  <em>'Pocahontas'</em> is an enjoyable flick from 1995. The animation is lovely, while the voice cast each do fine jobs. The premise raises noteworthy thoughts regarding British colonisation. It isn't perfect and isn't in-depth by any means, but I like what the film takes on.  Irene Bedard does well in the lead role, while the seemingly ever topical Mel Gibson supports ably. It's also interesting to hear a young Christian Bale involved as Thomas. Billy Connolly appears too, though only minorly.  The animation and music are the key parts to this. The songs aren't massively memorable but are catchy, the score is solid throughout but really comes up big at the end. Most of the humour, mainly with the animals, is fun too.  Overall, it's a production worth watching. Never really got into this movie. It's ok but I don't think it's as good as everyone gives it credit for. A gentle telling of the tale of early British settlers arriving in Virginia in the 17th",3

Meanwhile, his wife (Helena Bonham Carter) is caught up in her ambitious work as a curator of art galleries, not to mention the serious flirting of a colleague (Peter Weller).  A Greek chorus occasionally chimes in (F. Murray Abraham, etc.), linking the story to that of Oedipus.  “Mighty Aphrodite” (1995) is a quirky comedy set in Manhattan, which is unsurprising with Woody at the helm. The heart of the plot, described in my title blurb above, is reminiscent of “Hardcore” (1979) minus the gravity.   Both Helena and Mira were in their prime and look great in totally opposite ways. The flick is amusing, touching and ironic.

That's not to say it's a serious football film, it certainly isn't and the ball game isn't even the main takeaway from events - it's more about people caring and coming together. It's rather nice.  There's nothing really noteworthy about the cast to be honest, Olivia d'Abo (Anna) and Steve Guttenberg (Tom) are, I guess, the standouts.

Things get worse, of course, if the man is shy or less experienced in Cupid's dealings. Then, yes, things get really complicated!  Contrary to what the film might make us think, it is not necessary to be a poet to tell a beautiful woman that we love her. Well, from the little that has happened to me, what often happens is that love itself transforms us into incidental, fortuitous poets. And if the first verses are given to us by the gods, the muse of our affection easily inspires the rest.

It did, particularly the episodes concerning Terrence Howard (playing Louis Russ) and angelic Jean Louisa Kelly (Rowena).    The movie’s kind of a meshing of “Dead Poets Society” (1989) crossed with “Forrest Gump” (1994), although not great like either of those flicks.

71,Fair Game (1995),Action,"Although panned by most critics, Fair Game (1995) is not nearly as bad as some would lead you to believe... especially if it's taken purely at face value. Based on the novel of the same name by Paula Gosling, the story had previously been filmed as Cobra (1986) starring Sylvester Stallone. For all intents and purposes, Fair Game is a decent action movie, although overindulgent in most aspects (huge explosions, gratuitous boob shots of Cindy Crawford, nudity, a famous sex scene and one-note acting). The film was designed solely as a vehicle to capitalize on the enormous popularity of Cindy Crawford, the hottest Supermodel of the 1990's... and in that respect, it had enormous success. Fair Game has become a sort of Cult classic, based on the adoration for Crawford's sex appeal and a brief, early role by Salma Hayek. As far as her bad acting goes, Cindy Crawford said it best, taking the high road with ""Oh well, at least I tried."" Indeed, she deserves an ""A"" for effort.",1

132,Jade (1995),Thriller,"Well, this is trying to be an erotic thriller and it is trying to be neo noir... and it doesn't pull off either.  It seems to be constantly confused about which way to go, never committing to either genre and not really merging them together very well. Which is pretty sad given that erotic thriller and Noir tend to mix nicely for the most part and can seemlessly transition.  Jade didn't know how to mix them, and it couldn't decide which it wanted to be.  So, in the end, it hints at both and falls flat in both. Watched the ""Director's Cut"" which is about 12 minutes longer than the theatrical version. This seems to be leftovers from Joe Eszterhas's script of Basic Instinct and while I think it has its moments, could've been so much better and with a more charismatic lead might've made for a more memorable film as a whole, but David Caruso showed why he was far better suited for television. Still I can't say it wasn't watchable. **3.0/5**",2

But then it manages to peck, and mock, and spoof Miami Vice in pretty subtle ways through the film and it manages to do it without being a blatant Scary Movie style stupid spoof.

The three astronauts and Mission Control must now focus on merely surviving and getting back alive, if possible.   Directed by Ron Howard, “Apollo 13” (1995) is a solid account of the real-life events and obviously influenced “The Martian” twenty years later, which is even better, albeit not based on historical events.   I suppose this zeroes-in on the weakness of this movie: If you’re familiar with the account you know how the story ends, which diminishes suspense. Nevertheless, I found it interesting to observe the living conditions and challenges of real-life astronauts, as well as the resolve and ingenuity of the people at Mission Control to work with what’s available and to figure out how to get the astronauts home.      The film runs 2 hours, 20 minutes.

151,Rob Roy (1995),Drama|Romance|War,"Do not think that all sins go unpunished in this life, Montrose.   Rob Roy is directed by Michael Caton-Jones and written by Alan Sharp. It stars Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Andrew Keir and Brian Cox. Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub.  Neeson is Rob Roy MacGregor, an 18th Century Scottish historical figure who borrows £1,000 from the Marquis of Montrose (Hurt) with the plan to improve his clan's way of life. But the money is stolen in transit by the dastardly Archibald Cunnigham (Roth), so unable to repay the loan, Roy is forced to live as an outlaw. From such seeds are legends born.  Beautifully shot on location in parts of the Scottish Highlands, Rob Roy somewhat got lost in the slip stream of Mel Gibson's Braveheart. A shame, for although not as epic or as rousing as Gibson's Oscar grabber, Caton-Jones' film is a different and more reflective type of historical piece. Thematically the film is a play on vi",3
152,"Addiction, The (1995)",Horror,"Even for an arthouse vampire film, it's pretentious, and that's quite an achievement. Existentialism abounds but substance (no pun intended) does not.  Good for audio sampling though.  _Final rating:★★½ - Not quite for me, but I definitely get the appeal._ The Addiction is one of the more thoughtful films about vampirism available today.  While the film is incredibly thoughtful, with loads of subtext at every corner, it borders, and sometimes crosses into, pretention. There are times where the narration is attempting to add subtext, but it's so heavy-handed that the film loses sight of the fact it's a horror film. I'd argue it's thought piece first and horror film second, honestly. Maybe that makes it even more frightening.   Christopher Walken is wonderful, and Lili Taylor does a fine job, as well. The choice to shoot the film in black and white was a great idea, as well. There's a real focus placed on the ideas the film is pursuing.   Even though the subject of the horror i",2
153,Batman Forever (1995),Action|Adventure|Comedy|Crime,"A different direction brings differing results.  Batman takes on a new side kick as he fights to keep Gotham City out of the clutches of Two-Face and The Riddler.  ""No thanks, I'll get drive-thru""  Thus these be the first words out of Val Kilmer's incarnation of Batman and thus setting the standard for what Joel Schumacher's two Batman movies would be like. Gone is the dark undertone from Tim Burton's visions, and the tight action sequences that marked Burton's debut out as a genuine genre piece of work, in their place comes sexy campery and ropey action set pieces. The casting of both Val Kilmer as Batman and Chris O'Donnell as Robin is a big mistake, Kilmer easily being the most boring actor to don the suit out of all of them, whilst O'Donnell simply can't act outside of Robin's cartoonery bravado. Nicole Kidman looks positively gorgeous as Chase Meridian, but that's all that is brought to the party, it's a waste of the very talented Kidman's ability and a waste of the audience",4
154,Belle de jour (1967),Drama,"A wonderful parable of love, relationships and the place in both for fantasy and imagination. Certainly much more enjoyable to watch, not to mention better acted and directed, than recent delvings into that subject matter, like Lars von Trier's Nymphomaniac (though that wasn't the latter's point). Intensely beautifully photographed, with wonderful performances, most especially by Catherine Deneuve. You can't go wrong with 60's and 70's Bunuel, that's for sure. A blunt surprise insofar as the movies stark depictions of both a young woman's eccentric erotic fantasies alongside a rather harsh alternative lifestyle. In the middle there is a very conventional and ordinary real life tale of a married couple where the husband has no idea what's going on within his wife's mind, and life, both past and present.   Reality and fantasy seem to blend in a young woman's mind implicitly suggestive of prior experiences that influenced the lead character's real and imaginary manifestations. Not for chi",3

Cathy Moriarty plays the venal heir of the mansion and Eric Idle her assistant.  “Casper” (1995) delivers the goods if you're in the mood for a ""spooktacular"" Goosebumps-like horror film that's fun & silly and not scary at all. It's like Scooby-Doo but without the dog and the teens are tweens. “Monster Night” (2006) and “Ghostbusters” (1984) are other reference points, but I prefer “Monster Night,” which has a similar plot, but is all-around more entertaining (even though it cost significantly less) and has a superior assortment of good-lookin' women, young and older.

160,Congo (1995),Action|Adventure|Mystery|Sci-Fi,"The movie is very boring. A talking gorilla is pretty cool. I actually was about to shut the movie off cause it was that boring. Then all of a sudden the movie took a awesome turn at the end. It went from a family friendly boring movie to a horror show. Now I'm usually a fan of Tim Curry but quite what he is doing in this rather weak and feeble hybrid of ""Tarzan"" meets ""King Solomon's Mines"" is anyone's guess. It's all about the search for a lost expedition that was being led by the son of an American industrialist who was seeking diamonds large enough to power a laser (ostensibly for communications purposes, but who really knows?). Anyway, they disappear so it falls to Curry and Laura Linney's ""Dr. Rees"" to follow the sagely guidance of the Quatermain-esque ""Kelly"" (Ernie Hudson) deep into the hostile terrain of the jungle. It's got just about everything required to make it flop, this film. Terrible acting, even worse dialogue - and that's just from the chatty gorilla that all too oft",2

A patrolling US nuclear submarine is ordered to fire, but almost straight afterwards an incomplete counter order brings uncertainty. The submarine Captain and the Executive Officer come into conflict as to which order to follow, and thus the subs crew are torn as to which officer is right or wrong.  Directed by Tony Scott, one could be forgiven for thinking that Crimson Tide would be an outlandish ball of explosions and slaughter, thankfully it isn't, as Scott gives us one of the best underwater thrillers going. Scintilating characters are cloaked in dynamic claustrophobia, and this coupled with the ever increasing unbearable tension, makes this a must see for fans of films that are scary because of what might happen, and not because of what many blockbuster film makers actually show you.  This is not a standard ",3

Though I love his work on the Sin City films, particularly the first, his incredible earlier trilogy will always hold a special place in my cinephilic heart.  My recent project of coming to terms with classic Westerns has only further helped me enjoy these more recent contemporary releases. **Action, shots, bullets and… “latinxploitation”?**  I confess that I expected something more from this film. I was left with the feeling that it has little to offer us other than two tons of spectacular action scenes, with explosions, hundreds of gunshots and some gratuitous destruction.

It stars Denzel Washington, Tom Sizemore, Jennifer Beals, Don Cheadle and Maury Chaykin. Music is by Elmer Bernstein and cinematography by Tak Fujimoto.  Carl Franklin had already laid down a considerable neo-noir marker with his searing 1992 thriller One False Move, here he goes more traditional but garners equally impressive results.

It is much more original than its predecessor, and has much higher-caliber supporting players in Jeremy Irons and Samuel L.

Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"" is certainly the most epic of the three at three hours, but I found it overrated; which isn't to say I don't like it, I just don't feel that it's as great as the hype would suggest (only about half of it is worthwhile). I liked ""Rob Roy"" better than ""Braveheart;"" it's very adult-oriented, violent, gritty and grim, however.  ""First Knight"" is a believable take on the King Arthur/Camelot legend starring Sean Connery as Arthur, Richard Gere as Lancelot and Julia Ormond as Guinevere. They get tangled up in a bit of a love triangle. Ben Cross plays the villain, ex-knight Malagant.   Being a relatively realistic portrayal of the folkloric story, the tone is similar to “Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves” (1991), but without the witch and the campy Alan Rickman.

The first film, even with all the flaws, was quite good and was so enjoyable that it became a milestone for many people's childhood and adolescence. This one, in addition to not bringing anything really new, has more flaws and problems than its predecessor.  The film's biggest problem turns out to be the script: the action takes place some time after the events of the first film, but we continue to see Willy, the released orca, playing a heroic role in saving several other animals after an oil spill resulting from an accident with a tanker that passed too close to the shore.

171,Jeffrey (1995),Comedy,"I kept expecting Sir Ian McKellen to pop up here to compliment the entertainingly camp contribution from his best pal Patrick Stewart in this otherwise rather unremarkable story. It’s all about “Jeffrey” (Steven Weber) who is one of those actors-cum-waiters who merrily enjoys the fruits of his New York existence until the arrival of AIDS turn him into a sexually neurotic monk. No more nookie for him, it’s all about his career - and, yep, that just frustrates the poor man. Things aren’t exactly helped by his flamboyant pal “Sterling” (Stewart) who has a much younger and HIV+ boyfriend “Darius” (Bryan Batt) who keeps telling him that he needs to get laid more. Then he bumps into “Steve” (Michael T. Weiss) and they take to each other. Snag? Well it turns out that “Steve” is also positive and so “Jeffrey” is now faced with quite a dilemma.

It's really dated, but it's good enough I would actually like to see a reboot of this.  There isn't a lot to say: the production and execution fell short and it's just not worth going back to watch this one.

Unfortunately, when it comes to the film industry, the plot-link is kind of the most important one, so I can't really call Judge Dredd a success. And although the general premise is strong, this is not to the credit of the movie, seeing as it sources its material from the comic books of the same name, and 2000 AD.  Sylvester Stallone (the titular Dredd) and Rob Schneider (his offsider) are perhaps poor casting options. But they aren't so terrible as to make Judge Dredd unwatchable, especially seeing as there are a quite a few good choices to balance this out.  Despite being made in '95, it shares that intrinsically 1980's vision of a dystopian future, where all the buildings are black, all the signs are neon, and all the residents are androgynous punks and goths.

The ""anti-Jaws"" approach of showing the monster off is really cool as the premise is largely how detailed and dangerous the xenos is, but the approach removes a lot of the suspense in the hunting and subterfuge, almost humanizing her as ""hunted by the evil government entity"".  While it would be a much different, and arguably better, movie to do something more like ""The Thing"", that she only has one human mask sorts of outs her, making it more like a spy movie, and I think they did really well with that in mind.  It just lacks the level of nuance and hidden information that spy and thriller movies tend to have.  It's much closer to ""Aliens"" than ""Alien"". _**Wiping out the ""galactic weed**_""  Released in 1995, ""Species"" chronicles events after SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) receives a transmission from ",3

In this specific case, the end of the millennium is a time of social and political chaos, in which society moves without a clear direction, given over to fleeting pleasures and criminal acts. And in the midst of all the dissolution of morals and values, a mechanism emerges that allows the recording of the memories and sensations of the person who uses it, leading to a black market in illicit recordings of crimes, sex and controversial acts: thus, a man who never stole, killed or cheated on his wife can experience all of this without necessarily having to do so. But what happens when a recording keeps evidence of a murder?  The film has qualities, and presents a story that mixes sci-fi, political thriller and a little romance, in a mix that has aged very well, even though we ar",1

I like the influence he has had on independent cinema. 1994 certainly proved to be an important year for it, with the smash successes that independent studios had with 'Clerks' and 'Pulp Fiction'. I hope he sticks to directing films that he himself writes. I have the feeling he wants to expand his horizons but isn't quite sure how to go about it without alienating his huge fanbase. I have great confidence in him, and feel that if he puts his heart into it, he can be a great filmmaker, instead of a good one.

It's an interesting idea acted well by very good actors (a lot of people dismiss Marlon Brando's work here, but I don't think it's that bad, honestly).

I won't dwell on this point, just add that this film covers the filming of “Glenn or Glenda”, “Bride of the Monster” and “Plan 9 from Outer Space”.

His flaws are writ large from the beginning; his, at times, quite brutal upbringing and his womanising certainly didn't make him the nicest of men; and as his deafness takes over his character becomes more irascible and unpredictable. The story is presented as a retrospective, starting at his funeral, and is largely described through the perspective of his friend Anton Schindler (a considered effort from Jeroen Krabbé) and we see how his nature could vacillate from kindly, cruel, passionate and loving to selfish and vile.

What we can diagnose to be likely porphyria today, was simply madness back then.  The Madness of King George has its aspects of tragedy, family drama, intrigue, comedy; but always present are the reflections about politics, power, monarchy and what it is, can be, should be (and whether at all).  It presents itself as a period piece, but written as a theatre play in 1994, it is at the same time a contemporary deliberation, with some jibes and jokes about things which seem to never change... in the UK, at least.  Viewers in The Colonies might enjoy it as well.  I sure did, not least because of the great Nigel Hawthorne, who won the Best Leading Actor BAFTA for this, and plays Mr. King in a very touching way.

273,Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1994),Drama|Horror,"Excellent version of an enduring classic  This is not a monster movie in any shallow slasher sense. It probes and contemplates some eternal questions humans have been pondering for thousands of years, set in a time when so many things we know today were yet unknown, adding to the mystery and horror of the situations that occurred. This movie has pathos, sumptuous sets, costumes and screenplay, some utterly disturbing scenes and ideas, and culminates in classic tragedy. ***Gothic mania with Kenneth Branagh, Robert DeNiro and Helena Bonham Carter***  Kenneth Branagh's 1994 version of the oft-filmed Frankenstein story was the most faithful to Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel up to that point, which explains its name.

I found it charming and suitably acted.  I assume the major dislike of this film is the secondary plot featuring Joey (Richard Portnow) & Co., which I would agree is unimaginative and ill-fitting. However, that doesn't affect my overall feelings. Another thing I see mentioned is the Native American stuff, I don't think it's fair to say it's ""racist"" - insensitive? potentially - if anything, it mentions a few times the negative depictions; somewhat surprisingly, for a 1995 release anyway.  The story between Ben (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), Jack (Chevy Chase) and Sandy (Farrah Fawcett) is nice.

Gary Oldman plays the heartless Warden (technically associate Warden) while R. Lee Ermey is on hand as the judge.    ""Murder in the First"" (1995) is a prison/courtroom drama that says its “inspired by true events,” which means it’s NOT a biography of the real Henri Young, but rather uses Young’s basic story as a microcosm for unveiling several of Alcatraz’ dubious and inhumane doings during the 30s. Look up the real history after viewing the movie, yet not just Young’s story and the trial, but also the ‘Dungeon’ and how prisoners were treated in solitary confinement during the early years of that infamous ‘Rock.’  The movie successfully brings the viewer back to the 30s and early 40s, but the filmmakers laid it on too thick in regards to how ee-",1

The script written by Tarantino is an authentic carnage that massacred not only a random number of extras but also popular culture.  Ever since the mass media appeared, alarmist and high-sounding voices have occasionally emerged to warn of the enormous dangers they pose. Over the decades, criticism has echoed around the appreciation for what is violent or has sexual connotations. I agree with some, if not most, of the criticisms, although I cannot accept people being considered stupid enough to start carrying out massacres or sexual orgies just because of what they see on certain TV shows.

It's a violent film, with a raw brutality that shocks us by how authentic it sounds. Domestic violence? Child rape? It's not something you only see in the movies. It's something you see in a newspaper. That's what shocks us the most: knowing it's something real. And I warn you now: there are violent films, but this one is really intense and shocking... a lot.  The film takes place in Auckland, in a poor suburb built by the State for people with very low incomes.

Sure there are movies about comas, amnesia, lying, but they don't do it in the same way, and I honestly believe it's because this movie did it so well that no one wants to risk copying it and do worse.  This is also a great example of good situational comedy without bleeding over into abuse humor: at no point is she ""suffering"", she's not attacked, or wronged, but she's in a difficult situation that doesn't lend towards pleasantness in a ridiculous fashion, mostly because the family is insane, in the best of ways.  Every single actor in this really brings it too.

One of my favorite movies of all time. **Jim Carrey is the movie.**  Jim Carrey is one of the great comic actors of the 90's, and this film is one of those that opened the doors of stardom for him. He already worked with comedy before, of course, as an actor and stand-up artist, and he took advantage of this background to build Ace, an animal detective with eccentric habits and manners.  In general, this type of comedy is not to my liking, but I have to recognize Carrey's enormous qualities and talent. In cooperation with director Tom Shadyac (I don't know if it was the first, but there were several throughout their career), the actor did a truly inspired job that gives the film all its strength and originality. Imagining this movie without Carrey is impossible. Sure, there's a lot of exaggeration, and the rest of the cast is driven to exaggerate, trying to keep up with the pro",2

A transvestite is anyone who wears clothing belonging to the opposite sex to look like that. A transsexual is anyone who believes that they should have been born with the opposite sex to the one they have, and who, not infrequently, begins to undergo medical treatments in order to achieve the physical appearance they desire. What do they have in common? Both are minorities of little expression within the “gay” movement and, despite being visible, they have demands that sometimes contradict those of the homosexual movement, leading to some internal friction.  None of this really matters, but it helps to understand why the group keeps this film on their favorites list.

Condensing Clancy's door stoppers is no easy task, but the makers here, headed by director Phillip Noyce, have manged to keep the pic brisk and intelligent for entertainment worth.  Plot essentially boils down to America's war on drugs and the Colombian cartel at the helm of such operations. Naturally all is a bit suspect in the American corridors of power, leading to corruption and abuse of power that puts Jack Ryan firmly at the front to sift and destroy the bad eggs staining the American Star Spangled Banner.  This very much plays out for those who like a bit of politico subterfuge, whist being ok with long passages of like minded chatter is also a requisite.

That's a tricky one to answer because we all deep down have a morbid curiosity about us, especially with films and their stars.

Speaking of which, this explains why ""The Flintstones"" is such easy prey to incessant panning – it's a movie based on a cartoon. So freaking what? The question is, does it work for what it is and the answer is a resounding ""yes""! Movies should be critiqued and graded according to what they are and aspire to achieve. For instance, ""Godzilla"" is a colossal-creature movie and should be reviewed on that level.

I found Andie MacDowell's performance very wooden. I appreciate them not going the obvious route with Kristin Scott Thomas' character, even if it makes her Fiona redundant throughout.  Just about serviceable, worth watching if only once.

Gone are the established cast and therefore most of the chemistry as Eddie Murphy reprises his role as loud-mouthed cop ""Axel Foley"" just once too often. It has many of the ingredients that made this franchise successful, but somehow the seriously B-list supporting cast and the repetitive nature of the action scenes just don't really work nearly so well.

I haven't even bothered seeing the original yet (the more highly-regarded work that surprisingly won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Palance).  I cared not a single whit about the plot--it was just fun watching the stars interact and riff off of each other. I did feel that the direction lagged in places, and perhaps a more objective editor could have sliced 10-15 minutes off and no one would have been the wiser. Not bad considering it was a sequel--it's worth a couple of watches, though I'm not surprised, and I'm a tad relieved, that no more of them were made.",1

Let the soft side of you out and enjoy this film. Kevin Kline is “Dave”, an unassuming fellow who is recruited by the Secret Service to double for the President of the USA whilst he goes for some extracurricular horizontal jogging.

Today I think it has been forgotten, and in part I feel sorry for it. However, I believe that the film has already done its job: not only did it entertain those who saw it and continue to see it, but it also had a certain social role in the way it awakened in younger people (but not only them) a certain awareness of ecology, for the preservation of endangered animals and species. I also believe that the film had a certain responsibility for changing the thinking of zoos and places that keep animals in captivity: instead of being “animal deposits” for public entertainment, they became institutions with ever greater relevance in the preservation of a",2

As he pursues the one-armed killer & those who pulled his strings, a determined U.S. Marshal (Tommy Lee Jones) hunts Kimble down from wilderness regions to the streets of Chicago.  The first 40 minutes contain the most action, hooking the viewer with an exhilarating bus wreck/train wreck followed by a phenomenal dam sequence. The rest of the movie is an intelligent and suspenseful cat-and-mouse chase with Kimble zeroing-in on those who framed him and why.  “The Fugitive” was a deserved box office hit, costing $40 million and raking in $369 million with $184 of that domestically.

Jason Patric is really quite good as the liaison officer who is charged with escorting Geronimo to a meeting with the government, epitomised by Gene Hackman as ""General Crook"" who is a measured, considerate soldier who appreciates, and has some sympathy with, their plight. During this journey, the two men start to form a bond based on their respective senses of honour and fairness; courage and trust.

501,Naked (1993),Drama,"Mike Leigh's 1993 film NAKED is a drama on sexual relations -- how men hurt women, how some women accept that hurt out of low self-esteem and a desire to be wanted or supported. It is distinguished by its remarkably lifelike characters. Most of the film was worked out in improvisations for several months before shooting began. Leigh wanted his actors to create elaborate back stories for their characters, fully living inside of them so that when the cameras started rolling they would be completely convincing.  As the film opens, Johnny (David Thewlis) has to flee Manchester after a sexual encounter with a married woman turns into rape and she threatens to set her husband after him. Stealing a car, he heads to London to crash at his ex-girlfriend Louise (Lesley Sharp), gets involved with her flatmate Sophie (Katrin Cartlidge), and spends a couple of nights homeless in London.

I quite liked this one.  There may not be anything outstanding, or even massively good, about <em>'The Next Karate Kid'</em>, but I actually felt content with what I had just watched when the end credits came along.

Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi) is a little cliché-filled but still super endearing and likeable. A young Hilary Swank, in her first major film role, brings a solid performance as Julie. At first I wasn't convinced, but by the end I felt like I saw a positive journey with the character.  In my opinion, it's the best sequel to 1984's <em>'The Karate Kid'</em>.

The details of this writer's life are known: the sexual abuse she suffered in childhood, the depressive crises, the existential doubts she experienced all her life, her bisexuality. And “Orlando” was born in this context: it is the result of the relationship between Woolf and Victoria Sackville West, an aristocrat who maintained an open marriage, in which she could live her sexuality with other women. To what extent have Victoria or the author herself, at certain moments, not wanted or fantasized about an eventual sex change?

It shows a number of events that you can tell are supposed to make you connect to Butch, but I just couldn't - he is super unlikeable, like the very first thing we see him do 'on the outside' defines him and the whole film. They could've wrote him in so many different ways, to give him a positive reason for what he does.  Yet, despite that it is entertaining, I cannot deny.

Of course she is too young to realise that were he to reciprocate in any way he'd be sent to jail! As so often happens with those who are picked on, she starts to pick on someone else - her little sister ""Missy"" (Daria Kalinina) and this earns her the annoyance of her family. Feeling adrift and rather abandoned, she begins to seek a bit of solace with her tormentor whilst never quite giving up on her older, would-be, beau - but what can come of any of this?

The catch is that the Chief Petty Officer in charge is a curmudgeon (Berenger) and the prisoner is a beautiful woman (Eleniak), not to mention this all happens on his last day before being discharged. Crispin Glover, Gary Busey, Dean Stockwell, Bitty Schram and Marilu Henner have bit parts.  “Chasers” (1994) is the last of seven movies directed by Dennis Hopper and, like his most popular flick “Easy Rider” (1969), it’s a road movie, except that this one has a sense of humor, which is mostly low-key and droll. I can’t believe it’s so obscure because this is easily one of the best road flicks ever made.   Comparable films include “The Last Detail” (1973), “Three for the Road” (1987) and “The Lucky Ones” (2007).

Well I think Pedro Almodóvar just about manages that here thanks to an amiably strong performance from the eponymous make-up artist (Verónique Forqué). We first meet her when she is drafted in by her lover ""Nicholas"" (Peter Coyote) to dress the corpse of his son ""Ramón"" (Àlex Casanovas). What might have helped would have been for the young man to actually be dead! Next thing, he is proposing to her - unaware of the thing with his dad - and they are living together. Happy ending? Well no, because it turns out that his mother killed herself - or did she? Star of red-top television ""Scarface"" (the super-hammy Victoria Abril) lives across the road and when not cavaliering around on her motorbike dressed like a mobile outside broadcast truck, she is rather voyeuristically filming from her terrace and finally, there's the horny porn star ""Pablo"" (Santiago Lajusticia) whose record",1

She's clearly not a local, and is heading for jail for begging before a supposed ""interpreter"" steps in claiming that he can understand her dialect and stating that she is really the eponymous character from a land far, far away.... The local ""Worrall"" landowners love the idea and embrace her. Not for her sake, of course, but because it adds kudos to their middle-ranking existence with the ""county set"". Thing is, is she actually a princess or is she just riding the wave - and a wave not necessarily of her own making? Despite the assembling of a strong cast here, the film flows a bit like treacle uphill. It looks great, the costumes and stately homes complemented by a suitably grand Richard Hartley score work well, but somehow the whole thing just lacks spirit.

585,"Brady Bunch Movie, The (1995)",Comedy,"_**Amusing and warmhearted parody of the beloved show**_  Growing up in a dysfunctional family, I watched the original Brady Bunch because I secretly longed for a normal family. This 1995 movie pokes fun at the Brady's wholesome and unified spirit, but also highlights their early-70's outlandishness by having the story take place in the mid-90s. Yet the movie’s never meanspirited; there’s a welcome warmheartedness.   Christine Taylor stands out as Marcia, although it's impossible to ever outdo the awesome Maureen McCormick. Jennifer Elise Cox also stands out as Jan, as does Gary Cole as Mike Brady. In the periphery, Marissa Ribisi is notable as Holly, who’s attracted to Peter, which says something in itself. Shelley Long is effective as Carol Brady, burdened by that absurd hairdo.  The film is amusing if you're familiar with the original show. And who isn't? If you like this one, the 1996 sequel ""A Very Brady Sequel"" is even better.  The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in the",1
586,Home Alone (1990),Children's|Comedy,"Doesn't really work if you actually spend the time to bother thinking about it, but so long as you don't _Home Alone_ is a pretty good time. There's really no likeable character, and it's honestly pretty mean spirited, but sometimes that's what you might need to defrag over Christmas.   _Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ Love this movie. I was 8 when this came out. I remember being so jealous of Kevin, because I wished I could be home alone like that to do whatever I wanted. It has taken me 30 years to sit down and watch this film and I'm quite glad I finally did. I usually loathe kids movies, and the trails at the time always put me off - but Macauley Culkin is really quite a charmer in this tale of a youngster who is accidentally left at home at Christmas by his family. They have jetted off to Paris leaving him alone facing the unwanted attentions of two would-be burglars (Joe Pesci & Daniel Stern). Initially a bit unsettled, he is soon is",4

Tony Goldwyn plays his business partner while Whoopi Goldberg is on hand as a psychic spiritual advisor.     Like all great movies, “Ghost” (1990) takes about 15-20 minutes to establish the characters and then takes off, gripping the viewer until the end. It combines drama, thrills and comedy in its fascinating exploration of the hereafter and is cut from the same cloth as future movies “City of Angels” (1998), “Meet Joe Black” (1998) and “The Sixth Sense” (1999).  While the film’s theology is no deeper than a Jack T. Chick tract and I don’t agree with every jot & tittle, it effectively conveys its profound ideas in a way that is palatable to the masses.  The movie runs 2 hours, 6 minutes and was shot in New York City (Manhattan and Brooklyn), Paramount Studios and downtown Los Angel",3
588,Aladdin (1992),Animation|Children's|Comedy|Musical,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)  Aladdin is one of Disney‘s most adored classics, being the indisputable favorite of many, many fans. The Lion King will always have that spot in my heart, but I also visited this story set in Agrabah dozens of times. Now, with the 2019’s remake about to premiere, I rewatched it last night and, once again, I fell in love. Honestly, I didn’t remember how funny and entertaining it is! It still holds up incredibly well, even though the film was released almost 30 years ago. The animation still looks stunning and fluid, but it’s the musical numbers and the voice work from the cast that makes this movie one of Disney‘s best.  As it’s known, Robin Williams shines in a role that stands out from his brilliant filmography, as his career-best interpretation of an animated character. Genie is one of the most versatile figures of Disney and Williams spreads out his wings of creativeness and imagination, delivering a phenome",4
589,Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991),Action|Sci-Fi|Thriller,"Terminator 2 is basically one of the greatest films of all time, its an absolute must watch if you like Science Fiction, Action, or even Comedy films. It could have been so bad, but the film somehow pulls it off with crazy stunts, an amazing cast and a great story.   The film really tackles the fate of humanity straight on which gets you thinking about our path as a species but also what we can do today to change things. The story takes you on a journey which is one of the most believable time travel movies of all time.  The action scenes are fantastic, with wall to wall fighting, car chases and military maneuvers that will keep you on the edge of your seat. That's mixed with a great cast and brilliant story telling from the directory. I would say its even better than the first movie which is also a classic.  Overall I have probably seen this movie 20 or 30 times over the last 25 years(go is it that long!!) and still don't get bored. Its a timeless classic that I urge everyone to",5
590,Dances with Wolves (1990),Adventure|Drama|Western,"One of my all-time favorite movies.  I can't begin to remember how many times I've seen it.  And I'll watch it again.  Kevin Costner gives a compelling performance, but so does the entire cast.  One gets a great sense of who the Lakota were and are.  Respect. I watched the extended version of this film, and I just have to say, any film that can run for FOUR HOURS and not come out the other end as a boring pile of garbage, is worthy of some pretty serious praise. That said, _Dances with Wolves_ is not really in my wheelhouse, and although it held my attention I can't see myself probably ever watching it again. Costner knows what he's about, and that's great, but a four-hour film about American history with strong romance elements is never going to blow me away.  _Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ There are two actor of recent years that I really struggle with. One is Tom Hanks, the other is Kevin Costner. His monotonic narrative as he conveys",3
591,Tough and Deadly (1995),Action|Drama|Thriller,"Tough and Deadly loses many tough points when we consider that Roddy Piper’s character’s name is Elmo Freech (doesn’t quite have the same ring to it as Sam Hell or John Nada, does it), or that his co-star is Billy Blanks, whose last name accurately describes his personality — or lack thereof.  The movie itself doesn't leave a very lasting impression, because anything resembling a logical plot has been eschewed in favor of a string of fight scenes one after another. I mean, there’s both a bar fight and a pool hall fight, and when the heroes aren’t fighting the bad guys, they’re fighting each other.   Moreover, an inordinate number of people fall to their deaths in the course of these fights; they fall off ledges, over railings, and through windows. Remember how Scott Pilgrim said he once kicked a guy so hard he saw the curvature of the Earth? Something kinda like that is going on here; Elmo punches this one guy so hard that the dude not only lands quite a ways away, but then continu",1
592,Batman (1989),Action|Adventure|Crime|Drama,"Vision not fully realised, but still a template of sorts.  It could never have lived up to the hype back in 1989, it was hailed as the film to rival the impact of ""Jaws"" & ""Star Wars"" as regards historical cinema conventions, it was, we were led to believe, a new age in cinema, or so it seemed. As it was, the film went down a treat for the modern cinema going audience, it raked in cash galore and spawned a raft of very inferior sequels, even though ultimately critics of the time were less than impressed.  So it makes for something of an interesting experience viewing it again as each decade passes. More so in light of Christopher Nolan's bank busting ""Dark Knight"" series of films. I remember the hype and marketing campaign (T-Shirts and toys bonanza) that ensured that the film could never live up to the gargantuan hype, and I'm honest enough to say that I was a little underwhelmed on first viewing. Yet time has been very kind to it, now showing that Burton had the nous and foresigh",5
593,"Silence of the Lambs, The (1991)",Drama|Thriller,"Unlike a lot of viewers, I first saw _The Silence of the Lambs_ at five years old. So, for me, _The Silence of the Lambs_ is a childhood favorite. Some would say I had an unusual childhood, in this age where some people actually **avoid** R-rated movies like the plague. The fact that I saw _Something Wild_, which Jonathan Demme directed five years before _The Silence of the Lambs_, as well as the original _Alien_ (alone at that), at the same age probably indicates that they were okay with me watching pretty much anything that wasn't rated X, though, honestly, I've **never** had any interest in that stuff. It was probably due to the fact that, like the movie's protagonist, I don't ""spook easily,"" and many so-called ""scary"" movies, including this one, never scared me, but (many of them) definitely thrilled me. Granted, I'd seen _Saving Private Ryan_ a few months before, which probably gave me a strong stomach. Well, enough about my wild, albeit fun, childhood. How does _The Silence of th",5

When, one morning, her validator gives her news less to her liking she determines to have her step daughter ""Snow White"" done away with. Her captain of the guard is dispatched into the forest with his young charge with instructions to see she doesn't return! He can't quite bring himself to murder the girl, so abandons her thinking the forest will do the job for him... Luckily, she stumbles upon the cottage of the seven dwarves - who depart each day to mine for jewels. They return home, discover her asleep in one of their tiny beds and after a bit of a bumpy start, take her to their hearts. That's basically the theme - the film has ""heart""; the dwarves reflect seven differing facets of human personality but all are sensitively enveloped in a glue of loyalty and humanity. All of these are tested as the wicked Queen discovers that the girl is still thriving (via her mirror) and sets out, pers",1
595,Beauty and the Beast (1991),Animation|Children's|Musical,"This is a magical animated interpretation of the Jeanne-Marie de Beaumont fairy tale.

Meantime, ""Belle"" is living in the village trying to avoid the endless amorous attentions of local beefcake ""Gaston"". Her father is travelling through the forest when he becomes caught up in a storm and seeks shelter in the Prince's castle - but he picks a rose and is duly imprisoned.

The ""Blue Fairy"" visits the old man one night and gives life to one of his creations ""Pinocchio"" - with ""Jiminy"" being given his conscience... All is going well until he has to go to school; en route to where he is waylaid by a foxy character who entices him with tales of success on the stage. Needless to say, nothing goes to plan and he embarks on a series of adventures that put him, ""Jiminy"" and his father in considerable peril. This is a much more complex storyline than you might expect; there is plenty of joy and fun, but also a darkness that provides food for thought for children and parents alike. The wonderful, Oscar winning, score is the best in the Disney repertoire and the characterisations are engaging. If it has any flaws: the dialogue - there is too much ",1

Enter a meeting with ebullient hooker Vivian Ward, who upon impressing Edward with her happy go lucky values, gets herself hired to be his escort for the week ahead, it's a week that both of them are unlikely to ever forget.  It almost became the in thing to stomp all over the respective work of both Richard Gere (Edward) and Julia Roberts (Vivian), adding fuel to the fire of those with an aversion to both actors is that the crowd pleasing Pretty Woman hails from that dreaded genre known as 1980s Rom-Com. Seemingly many can now not see just what made Pretty Woman so popular back in 1990.

The death of the ""Motion Picture Production Code"" in 1967 ushered in a new era for cinema goers, it was a time for brave and intelligent directors to step up to the plate to deliver stark and emotive thunder, and with ""The Wild Bunch"", director Sam Peckinpah achieved this by the shed load.  The Wild Bunch doesn't set out to be liked, it is a harsh eye opening perception of the Western genre, this is the other side of the coin to the millions of Westerns that whoop and holler as the hero gets the girl and rides off into the sunset.

Similar films were inspired by the same real-life episode: “Badlands” (1973), “Kalifornia” (1993) and “Natural Born Killers” (1994). Seventeen months after Starkweather’s spree he was wiped off the face of the earth via electric chair. Needless to say, we were wiser then.  While “Badlands” and “Kalifornia” were realistic, “Love and a .45” takes the satirical route à la “Natural Born Killers,” but it tries too hard to be an oddball cult flick about dirtbags, not to mention it’s shallow.

The setting of a snowy Minnesota really allows for some great isolation scenes and highlights the ""coldness"" of the motivations in the story.  I think they even summarize the events at one point as ""all over a little money"", and it's spot on.  I can't say that any one thing is spectacular, but everything is done so well, I honestly think this is a great example of how to shoot a movie.

That's because it, obviously, feels peculiar seeing a cat and two dogs in the wild. So what does this film do? It puts them back in their natural habitat, so you're just left with emotionless animals talking telepathically in street alleys. To no-one's surprise, that's super boring.  Credit to Michael J. Fox for reprising his role as Chance. He doesn't mind doing sequels, even ones of a poorer variety; e.g. <em>'Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild'</em> - on that note, I guess <em>'Atlantis: Milo's Return'</em> was a step too far, understandably so!  Elsewhere on the cast, all the main humans return as does Sally Field as Sassy.

Now the thrust of the story is hardly innovative.

The POV camerawork gives us a proximity to the story and characters that we rarely see. Sadly, though, the story itself is a little bit thin. Denzel Washington is tasked with investigating the worthiness of a deceased helicopter pilot during the Gulf war to receive the medal of honor. Assuming it would be a routine ratification, he interviews her crew only to find discrepancies and inconstancies that cast a shadow over the whole procedure. Had this just been a routine wartime tale, then it might have been ok - but the fact that it is based around a real wartime scenario, and married together with that sickly trumpet-based pseudo-military score and an annoyingly ""Semper Fi"" sort of mentality, the whole thing just sinks down into a mire of absurdity and sentimentality. Neither Denzel Washington nor Meg Ryan really have the weight to give this film any bite, oomph - or, for that matter, plausibility. Matt Damo",1

My main gripe with the movie was (and is) that it did not feel like a Mission Impossible movie.  Spoilers ahead! In the original series the team always succeeded, at least in the episodes I watched. However, the movie starts off with a big failure. Then to make matters worse we learn that Mr. Phelps, one of the original lead characters, is actually a traitor.

Easily appealing to children and young people, it is a family film that entertains and moves.  The film is set in an uncertain period of the Middle Ages, in a legendary European kingdom where the young and cruel Einon reigns with an iron fist and no heart. As a teenager, his life had been saved by a dragon that gave him half of its own heart. Now, he ignores his master's lessons of honor and bravery, and rules like a tyrant. However, the population is fed up with his excesses and Bowen, the king's former tutor, decides to lead the revolt against him with the help of a dragon, the last one still alive, and precisely the one that saved the king.  I'm not going to waste a lot of time on this film because it's far from being a relevant work for those involved, even though i",1

Witherspoon is the girl who invites drifter David McCall (Wahlberg) into her life, only to find he’s as unstable as unstable can be. Director Foley and his team then produce a film that pretty much cribs from a number of other similar themed movies. All of the key scenes will be instantly familiar to genre film watchers, and unfortunately the plot twists and turns come as no surprise.  However, in spite of the lack of originality in structure and narrative thrust, Fear is never dull, not even when Wahlberg is wistfully looking into Witherspoon’s eyes like a love sick puppy.

There is something deeply cynical about all this, especially if we consider the critical way in which the director thought of the film: it is a film that does not bother to explain historical events, presumes that we already know them, and works on them in order to criticize the way we look at war heroes.  I honestly prefer not to talk too much about the cast because I don't know any of those involved.

Young Apu, brimming with ambitious ideas fueled by his newfound ‘superior’ education, is confident he’s on the fast track to enlightenment. Meanwhile, though heartbroken, his mother clings to her pride as she watches him drift away. This poignant and, at times, exasperating dynamic is a powerful reminder that while we forge ahead, believing we know best, those we leave behind can only hope for a fleeting glance back.  The film is beautifully crafted, quietly profound, and visually poetic.

And yet, this film taking place in a different galaxy far, far away doesn't use any specially created sets or fancy ray guns. Instead, Godard simply shot the film at examples of modernist architecture in Paris, in industrial buildings, and among the room-sized IBM mainframe computers of his time.  In the dystopian city of Alphaville, all decisions are made by the gigantic Alpha 60 computer that pursues logic at all cost, banning human emotions and leaving the inhabitants zombified.

One night while driving home, Heidi (Lucinda Jenney), Billy's wife, begins fooling around in the car with him while he is driving. In the throes of passion, Billy does not see an elderly gypsy woman crossing the street, runs over her, and kills her. The judge and police chief conspire to cover the crime up, and the death is ruled accidental. That does not sit well with the old woman's even older father, Lempke (Michael Constantine), who brushes Billy's cheek and whispers the title of the film. Soon, Billy is dropping three or four pounds a day. He seems to be disappearing before everyone's eyes, but concern sets in.

743,Spy Hard (1996),Comedy,"I think Leslie Nielsen ought to have re-considered his involvement with this really cringe-making comedy. His ""Agent Dick"" and ""WD40"" monikers are the stuff of ""Carry On"" films, and the rest of the humour and dialogue is almost as childish. It's a ""Bond"" spoof, right from the Maurice Binder-inspired titles, but the plot is far inferior to even the worst of Ian Fleming's works. Nicolette Sheridan (""Ukrinsky"") does her best as his Russian counterpart as they both seek out a not-so-ruthless ""Rancor"" (Andy Griffith) who, of course, wants to take over the world - but the ensuing escapades border all to often on the ridiculously slapstick. The juice has already been well and truly squeezed from the ""Drebin"" style of hapless character with the daft expressions and double-entendre ridden lines; and this film seems to go on for far longer than the eighty minutes running time.

That alone makes this one work a significant, historical mile-post in cultural cinema.  Typically avant-garde, the film's sarcasm pointed at the bourgeois (capitalist) class is not only quite biting, but also quite humorous. It uses the juxtaposition of horrendously misfitting music as a means to an end. And it works beautifully.  Other than it's class struggle element, I'm not sure what else is relevant in the 21st century.

A personal favourite._ **An excellent family comedy with some social criticism in the mix.**  The film is one of the most famous family comedies of the 1990s, adapting the story of the same name by Roald Dahl for the screen, where a girl, who was born into an idiotic family unable to understand it, decides to win the right to go to school and to learn, which their parents do not value. However, at school, she comes across a cruel and sadistic headmistress who will become her biggest adversary, while her teacher becomes her best friend.  It's a very good and enjoyable film, with a nice comedy genre and some fantasy. The characters are reasonably well done, albeit a bit artificial in their conception, and the cast is very good. Mara Wilson, despite her youth, shone in the lead role and guaranteed the start of her acting career. Danny DeVito, who a",2

Unfortunately, it’s run by Lilith, the queen of all vampires (Angie Everhart).  ""Bordello of Blood"" (1996) is similar to the contemporaneous “From Dusk Till Dawn,” but it lacks the slow build-up to overblown horror in the last act, opting instead for unrestrained campy horror right out of the gate. It also lacks the ambition and class of “From Dusk” with its focus on R-rated female nudity and sleaze, which is thankfully counterbalanced by Eleniak’s winsome heroine and Dennis’ likable gruff protagonist. The flick’s worth watching just for Miller’s amusing one-liners throughout.  People complain about Everhart’s “bad acting,” but she’s very effective in the role. Meanwhile Feldman is entert",1

Understandably, the film remained very much alive in the heydays of VHS, I think it made its way to DVD, but gradually fell into oblivion where it currently rests. Is it deserved?

Still, it's a film I most certainly wouldn't recommend.  Sinbad gives the most noteworthy performance of the cast, in his role as Simms. Even so, it isn't anything great or memorable from him. All of the others aren't worth mentioning, though it is cool to see Rafiki himself, Robert Guillaume, make an appearance - I didn't actually know what he looked like before watching, but in one of his early scenes he laughs and I knew instantly it was that man.  The plot is what lets this down. Just a quick glance at the cover gives off negative vibes, while the opening few scenes don't give you any more confidence either. It's extremely predictable, as well as being rather messy - you don't see the villain until the final 20-25 minutes, so are waiting for around 70mins for the obvious to come to fruition.  I've seen worse from live-action Disney, but it's still",1

So it's all set up nicely for a high energy action comedy from the realm of buddy buddy bonanza. Sadly it has energy to burn but the execution of the comedy is weak to the point the makers have to resort to the base level of comedy writing to try and get laughs.   The odd line raises a chuckle, but quite often this is followed by a period of inanity, which in turn is followed by a ballsy action sequence (the makers very aware they quickly need to keep the demographic genre fans back on the clock).

I thought Mickey Rooney playing a Japanese character was in terrible taste, and apparently director Blake Edwards wished he could cast it over again.

I bow to Hitchcock in his creativity in visualizing Jimmy Stewart’s acrophobia by implementing one of the oldest cinematography techniques, using zoom lens as it zooms in while the object moves away, emphasizing his terrified feeling and insecurity whenever he’s at a particular height due to a chronic vertigo he suffers. As always, the film director’s cameo appearance has always been fascinating since we know it’s his habit therefore we will usually let our eyes wander throughout the film, trying to spot him.

This throws a spanner in the works for the older brother ""Linus"" (Humphrey Bogart) who plans a large scale merger to make his bouncy glass, and that involves his brother marrying the daughter of the partner company. ""David"" is having none of this, but after he has an untimely accident involving his backside and some broken glass, ""Linus"" concocts a plan to send ""Sabrina"" back to France. This erstwhile steely man does not, however, factor in the effect his hanging out with this vibrant and intelligent young woman",2

Initially, this all goes swimmingly until news reaches them that her father has been killed at the siege of Mafeking and she, now penniless, has to serve as a glorified scullery maid. Disbelieving of her father's fate, the young girl and her fellow skivvy ""Becky"" (Sybil Jason) have some fun escapades that make her some new friends amongst the war wounded (including a touching cameo from the shell-shocked Morton Lowry), severely test the patience of her reluctant new guardian and hopefully track down her father. Yes, it smacks a little of ""Cinderella"" with a little ""Annie"" thrown in too, but the star is on great form as she sails, nonchalantly, through the proceedings with a charming and engaging air.

918,Meet Me in St. Louis (1944),Musical,"A bit of cake and a song to blow away the wind of change.  A film that is firmly ticking all the boxes for those looking for a family classic to admire and tap your feet along with.

When the Father is requested to move to New York permanently with his job, the rest of the family are not that keen to leave their memories and their beloved home in St. Louis, and in to the mix is the varying degrees of blossoming love involving the elder daughters and their respective beaus.  This film is just so gorgeous on many fronts, the colour beautifully realises the tremendous scope director Vincent Minnelli brings with his recreation of the era, the attention to detail is quality supreme.

I believe that we should call it a modernism show, albeit exhibited in the form of a movie. While it might feel ""boring"", it forces you to rethink what philosophical level that a two-hour film can achieve. The focus on questions about life, intelligence, and time, is worth more attention than the sci-fi part (though the special effect of this movie is already way ahead of its time). The eighth wonder of the world. Easily 30+ viewings since I was a little kid.

To categorize it, one might say it’s an espionage thriller. But really, that covers merely the basics of what the film is all about. It’s got suspense, adventure, romance, humor, heroics, and a cast that couldn’t be improved upon if you tried!  In contrast, Hitchcock’s first American picture was the well-done, if somewhat plodding, Gothic thriller Rebecca. While Rebecca is still an excellent film in its own right, boasting the talents of Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, and others, it isn’t nearly as exciting or action-packed. Foreign Correspondent is the more important of Hitchcock’s films, made at the start of WWII, and a clear call for American entry into the war at that time. Rebecca may have won",2
930,Notorious (1946),Film-Noir|Romance|Thriller,"Good thriller from Alfred Hitschcock. Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant just ooze charisma in this classic Hitchcock story of espionage and romance.

Once in Rio, she is reunited with her arch-Nazi admirer ""Alexander"" (Claude Rains) and, at the insistence of her new boss (Louis Calhern) she marries him. What now ensues is a cleverly developing tale of treachery and betrayal tempered with plenty of humour and a little romance (of course she and ""Devlin"" fall for each other).

By his own admission it was a film he viewed as ""lightweight"", but such is the great mans talent, his softer cinematic efforts still punch the buttons and are films that many filmmakers can readily learn from.   In this one Hitchcock is purely making an entertaining piece for those in the right frame of mind, a splendid mixture of comedy and romance which also culminates in no shortage of dramatic entertainment as well. Cary Grant is perfectly debonair as the cat burglar John Robie, who here has to catch a thief because he is the chief suspect for a spout of robberies on the French Riviera.

The newly formed Soviet Union is a bit broke, so three of it's finest representatives have arrived with what was her priceless jewellery so they can sell it on.

She's a no-nonsense communist in the best tradition, but she hadn't quite factored in the charismatic Frenchman who aims to firmly insert a spanner in the works. What now ensues is a delightfully funny drama that takes a swipe at the establishments of both nations, at the all too frequent ridiculousness of dogma and at flawed and quirky human nature.

Which to an extent is true, hell they even slotted in one of ""My Fair Lady's"" thrown away songs, ""Say A Prayer For Me Tonight"", into Gigi's bubbly mix. But on its own terms, Gigi is still a vibrant and rewarding picture that holds up well with each passing year.  The story had already been done as a French film directed by Jacqueline Audry in 1950, and a year later it had been played dramatically straight on Broadway with Audrey Hepburn in the title role. So for sure it was already a well formed story. Lerner & Loewe merely added their ""Fair Lady"" formula, got the talented Vincente Minnelli to direct it and broke out",1

All the iconic scenes from the story are there, from the staff fight with Little John to the archery contest to Marian’s rescue. Errol Flynn’s best known performance, with De Havilland and Rathbone memorable as Maid Marian and Sir Guy of Gisborne. A treat for young and old. Outstanding - no other word for this.

Well Leslie Howard engenders exactly that feeling as he plays the hapless, lovestruck ""Philip"" who has fallen in love with the nasty, scheming ""Mildred"" - Bette Davis (with a rather dodgy English agent). The chemistry between the two of them is great. She treats him appallingly, yet like a doting puppy he comes back for more each time. John Cromwell keeps this going deftly; we see the characterisations from W. Somerset Maugham's novel unfold before us and I felt genuinely invested. Early on in Of Human Bondage Philip Carey (Leslie Howard) is told “You will never be anything but mediocre.” Soon after, Mildred Rogers is described as “anemic … ill-natured and contemptible.” Neither will ever do anything to disprove these assessments. Carey especially will never be able to overcome his weakness; he was literally born with a clubfoot, but his real problem is that he never develops a figur",2
960,Angel on My Shoulder (1946),Crime|Drama,"Above average tale of heaven and hell shenanigans.  I have to say that my rating for this film is somewhat clouded because that is exactly what the film's copy was, very cloudy. I can't believe there is not a restoration in line for this film from 1946, it is barely watchable and the sound mix is nigh on impossible to hear.  The film is standard fare as regards the tale of the bad man gets a shot at life again, only here it's with a kicker, and watching this film unfold is never less than interesting without actually pulling up any trees. Paul Muni is fine and plays our main protagonists dual personality with credible verve, and Claude Rains is clearly enjoying himself as the devil of the piece, and I heartily applaud the dark shift the film took for the final reel, yet it is a hard film to recommend unless you can see and hear it properly.  I have no hesitation in watching this film again if a restoration comes to pass, but until then I say approach with caution. 6/10 Claude Rai",2
961,Little Lord Fauntleroy (1936),Drama,"This is a splendid telling of Frances Hodgson Burnett's literal tale of rags to riches. Freddie Bartholomew is ""Ceddie"" who is living in Brooklyn with his mother ""Dearest"" (Dolores Costello) when he discovers that he is the heir to a great British Earldom. With the assistance of solicitor Henry Stephenson he travels to his new stately home to meet his austere old grandfather (C. Aubrey Smith), whose heart he completely melts... It's got a few twists and turns as he must deal with another claimant to his title, but that good will out is never in doubt. Batholomew is that rarest of child actors; he is engaging - no sign of any precociousness - and together with some good contributions from Guy Kibbee (""Mr. Hobbs"") and a very dapper looking Mickey Rooney (""Dick"") we have a delightful story of a thoroughly good-natured young boy who gives an old man a new lease of life.",1
962,They Made Me a Criminal (1939),Crime|Drama,"This is one of these films that you need to allow quite a bit of latitude, else you will rule it just too implausible and stop watching. John Garfield (""Johnnie"") is a world champion boxer who finds himself embroiled in the death of a journalist. His problem is, he was totally sozzled after his victory so cannot recall what he did, or didn't, do - so absconds to a remote Arizona ranch where he helps the elderly May Robson who runs a refuge for wayward teenagers. That's where he meets, and falls for ""Peggy"" (Gloria Dickson) and settles down to a respectable life helping teach the boys how to focus their energies on boxing. Thing is, New York plod ""Whelan"" (Claude Rains) is on his case, and soon this newly found utopia is at risk... Garfield does a fitting job here, he is eminently plausible as the flawed prizefighter and his character's evolution as the story develops is engaging too.

I mean, my mother didn't like my father's wives.   Danny Kaye was a wonderful performer, he would sing, dance, tell jokes, turn his face into rubber and just generally come off as a quality humanitarian. The Inspector General showcases all of those talents.   Directed by Henry Koster, The Inspector General is loosely adapted from Nikolai Gogol's classic Russian story, and it finds Kaye as a stooge of Walter Slezak's iffy tonic peddler who is mistaken by iffy officials of a small Russian town for the much feared and respected Inspector General. Cue mistaken identity mayhem as the music numbers, gags, visual contortions and all round slapstick ensues. Also along for the ride are Elsa Lanchester, Alan Hale, Barbara Bates and Gene Lockhart.  It's more a safe and solid Kaye movie for the family to enjoy, rather than a high end classic like The Court Jester, but sometimes the high energy jinks of Kaye is all ",1

It is here that he encounters a sceptical Madeleine Carroll and together they try to get to the bottom of this clever mystery.

966,"Walk in the Sun, A (1945)",Drama,"I found this a rather dry, dreary attempt to insert us into the heart of an American brigade charged with blowing up an Italian Bridge as WWII nears it close. Dana Andrews, Richard Conte and John Ireland contribute gritty, authentic performances as their tough, sanguine squad face trials and tribulations - but there are lengthy periods of dialogue that, whilst well written, can bog the story down in a surfeit of individual personalities. Ultimately, I think it is just too close to the bone for anyone but an experienced soldier to be able to extract any value because well made, as it is, it lacks humour or pathos and conveys just too effectively the weariness of all concerned. What rescues it, to some extent, is the POV style of direction - frequently we see/hear no more than the soldiers and that does have an evocative effect during the brief, but pretty hair-raising conflict scenes.",1

968,Night of the Living Dead (1968),Horror|Sci-Fi,"Night of the Living Dead is without a doubt a fantastically innovative film; creating the modern day interpretation of a zombie and forever changing the genre as we know it. There is a lot to like about this film, but unfortunately the limitations of its time hold it back, resulting in a somewhat boring viewing experience.   For starters, the story was pretty good. I really enjoyed how the plot focused on a single group of survivors and their thought process as they attempt to deal with the horror and panic of the dead reanimating. There was a tremendous amount of lore delivered via telecommunication broadcasts that I thought added to the movie perfectly.   The performances were uneven, some were quite stellar, particularly Duane Jones and Karl Hardman.

He's given quite a helping hand when ""Gaby"" arrives and ""Pepe"" falls for her - she reminds him of times gone by in Paris - and also causes quite a stir with his girlfriend ""Ines"" (Sigrid Gurie). It could certainly be doing with some additional wattage - but even so, the film is stylish to look at, and the performances from Boyer, Gurie, Gene Lockhart and Alan Hale as a sort of prophetic grandfather kind of character add a quite a lot of richness to Henri La Barthe's pretty nondescript, very dialogue heavy, 1931 novel.

Nonetheless, it's unmistakably high quality and remains very watchable, enduringly appealing, and, in places, impressive.  The big glaring shortcomings are the experimental moments - which don't work and are distracting - and the fact that Miss Hayes is, much of the time, given over-ripe, unnaturally worded and stagy sounding dialogue to speak - and so much of the time, despite that she does give a fine, clearly talented performance, she does so in stage-performer mode and with ""impress them with my craft"" line delivery, rather than in the much more subtle and truly naturalistic way that's right for movie acting.

I can't vouch, much, for any historical authenticity - it is just a Disney film that celebrates the legend of the man, and his long-time sidekick George Russel (Buddy Ebden) with a catchy theme song and lots of action scenes. It has twinges of a social conscience - using Crockett as a conduit for the principles of fairness, decency and loyalty that underpinned much of he traditions of the ""Founding Fathers"" of the USA back at the start. Parker is a little wooden in the lead, but works well with Ebden to create an enjoyable, at time amusing, action adventure well worth a watch.

The whole feel of this is more engaging, helped by the fact that it gives the animals a voice which works better than just a sole narrator; as was done in the 60s.  Michael J. Fox is a strong choice for the voice role of Chance, while Sally Field and Don Ameche are solid in their roles as Sassy and Shadow respectively. Those three help make this a fairly enjoyable 84 minutes.  Another positive thing is the locations, with some wonderful shots of the environment that the animals traverse ",1

Here, the character motivations are much more consistent and the ending is no longer nonsensical. The finale also has a very watchable event occur, which helps too.  I thoroughly enjoy the cast here. John Mills is as good as William (aka Father) as Thomas Mitchell is, though Dorothy McGuire fronts a much improved Elizabeth (aka Mother) who is more developed; still not perfect, but certainly better.  Elsewhere, you have three of the Disney resident youngsters teaming up in James MacArthur (Fritz), Tommy Kirk (Ernst) and Kevin Corcoran (Francis).

Danny Glover is top notch as George, as is a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Roger. You also have Tony Danza (Mel), Neal McDonough (Bass), Adrien Brody (Danny) and Christopher Lloyd (Al) all involved. Not a bad list at all, though I would've loved to have seen more of Lloyd who is very underused - his role, if more prevalent, could've raised the film up massively.  With all the silliness of the plot, there is still a nice amount of heart in there - which is entirely predictable, but I a",1

There are quite a few places in the film where he can be seen smiling and having a good time, like when he makes it back to England after the Crusades or when he's spending time with Marian in Sherwood Forest. Thankfully, he's more three-dimensional than this and so you also see him desperate, angry, grieving, vengeful, strategizing, contemplative, etc.  To be honest with you, Costner was in his prime at the time and towers in the role; whether or not you like him is a matter of opinion.

Despite this, the return of Robin Williams as the genie is a bright spot in the film.  Despite its flaws, I appreciate this chapter in Aladdin's story and the continuation of the characters' journeys. The inclusion of Aladdin's father and the development of other villains enrich the overall narrative. While I cherish the Aladdin story and i",2

Joan Fontaine is ""Lady Alyce"" an heiress who casually meets visiting dancer/composer Fred Astaire (""Jerry"") on a trip to London. Their romance is soon smouldering (well, as much as anything actually smouldered in 1937), much to the chagrin of her well-to-do family at their ancestral ""Tottney Castle"". Aided and abetted by George Burns, his press man (""George"") and Gracie Allen (""Gracie""), his secretary - who offer an efficient if not terrific foil for the slightly obvious gags - he persists in pursuing his love. The dancing, almost all of which is performed en seul by Astaire - illustrates well his skill and the quality of the Gershwin's score, but somehow his solo performances just don't really engage.

It would appear that Samuels was visited by a group of drunken soldiers the previous evening, and with one of them seemingly missing, the evidence certainly implicates the missing soldier. But as detective Finlay digs deeper into the case he finds that they could be barking up the wrong tree, and that this crime is dealing with something desperately sad and vile - anti-Semitism.  Crossfire was born out of the novel written by Richard Brooks, adapted by John Paxton and directed by the shrewdly excellent Edward Dmtryk. Crossfire (originaly titled ""Cradle Of Fear"") is a taut and gripping picture that boldly tackles anti-Semitism.

The script picks up the story where the first one interrupts it: Jean's death and the selling of the land to the Soubeyran's. While the widow returns to her career as a lyric singer, her young daughter stays behind, becomes a goat herder and grows into a woman so beautiful that, years later, drives Ugolin Soubeyran crazy.

He deliberately let himself fall on a stair to injure himself and stop his growth. Oskar's refusal to grow and release his tin drum is an obvious metaphor about refusing the Nazi regime. This is made more obvious since he finally decided to grow and let go of his drum after the Nazi's defeat.  The Tin Drum is based on a celebrated novel by German author Gunter Grass. Director Volker Schlöndorff brings it to life with profound elegance and intellectual humor. Made in 1979, in the middle of the German film renaissance, The Tin Drum pokes fun at the Nazi regime and at the same time presents an unforgettable and often hilarious story.  The movie begins in the late 19th century when Oskar's grandmother helps his grandfather to escape German soldiers by letting him hide under her skirt.

It was treated like a surreal nightmare: it's a story about a butcher who occasionally sells human flesh in a dystopian future.  Regardless of how much I felt disgusted by the aesthetics adopted in the film and by its bizarre theme, there is no doubt that it was a work with notes of quality: the degradation of buildings and the environment symbolizes or synthesizes the degradation of morals and values.

The progression of Ripley was really defined by this movie the 'brave but scared' Ripley of Alien is gone and a more determined, meaner Ripley emerges with elements of the older nurturing character kept in check with a young girl called Newt. It definitely stands out miles compared to all the other 80's alien-type movies of that decade. ""Ripley and the Soldiers"" can be found in two versions: the short version that cuts from Midway station directly to the Weyland-Yutani hearing, and the ""director's cut"" which cuts to a waiting room with a wall size ""scenery channel"" display. When I first saw the short version, I wondered how Ripley was able to make an immediate connectio",5

This film seems to me a little forgotten nowadays, but it deserves a review for its enormous quality.  In fact, the whole story revolves around trust in others and in ourselves. Maria, a young teenager who seems determined to stand out in an extravagant way, has just become pregnant with a boyfriend who really doesn't like her and only cares about his personal priorities.

In truth the effects work is a little creaky now but that doesn't matter, they were awesome in 1984. It's a ripper of a story awash with high energy action, rip-snorting characterisations and tech-noir atmospherics. It's place in the pantheon of science fiction films is assured, its influence on the genre undoubted, while the lead cast members cemented themselves in the sci-fi hall of fame.  No more needs to be said really, The Terminator is a kinetic live action comic book of a movie, classy movie making, paced to precision and featuring a story that's brilliantly complex and utterly compelling. 9/10 Writing a review for a movie this old does indeed seem pointless, but since this is one of my favorite films I thought I would review it anyway.  ",5

And no, it never makes us laugh, so it's not a comedy.

Led by their white leader (Shaw), they must overcome bigotry, in fighting and the war itself, and this just to feel like men of honour.  The most striking thing about Glory is that it is never over sentimental. With the subject to hand it would have been easy for the makers to over egg the pudding and rely solely on a racialist stance purely for impact. What we do get is actually a candidate for one of the most politically correct war films to have ever been made.

1243,Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (1990),Comedy|Drama,"**Rosencrantz and Guildenstern must remain in the theater.**  This film is perhaps the proof that not all successful plays are good enough to work in the cinema. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are two characters from “Hamlet”, by William Shakespeare, but it is difficult for anyone to remember them without being very knowledgeable about the literary work in question. They really barely matter to the action. Here, they are the main actors, and we are invited, in a way, to see things through their eyes. In theater, this is interesting. In the cinema, and for a general audience that doesn't know “Hamlet” so well, this doesn't seem like a good idea.  Gary Oldman and Tim Roth brought the main roles to life with great panache and value, and the film ends up not being an absolute waste of time thanks to these two magnificent and valuable actors, full of talent.

Visually it's his best work (for those who don't know, the cinematographer Gordon Willis did The Godfather Parts 1 & 2 earlier the same decade, so it's no surprise). Not as insightful or engrossing as Hannah or Misdemeanors, but the writing's up there. Mariel Hemingway's a crown jewel and tears me apart. If you're a newbie and can watch this before Annie Hall I highly recommend it. It's aged much better and is _the_ Woody Allen litmus test **In the shadow of “Annie Hall”.**  I decided to watch this film last week, after the visit that Woody Allen himself made to my country, with his jazz band and an interesting lecture at the National Cinematheque for invitations only.

1245,Miller's Crossing (1990),Drama,"The answer my friend is a hat blowing in the wind.  The Coen brothers craft a loving homage to gangster pictures of yore with splendid results. Essentially the plot has Gabriel Byrne as a good - bad guy caught between two rival gangster factions. It's a standard story line that is still providing cinematic water for many a film maker these days, but shot through the Coen prism, with literary astuteness holding court, it's a genre piece of considerable class. A picture in fact that gets better and better with further viewings.  When the Coen's are on form they have the skills to make a grade ""A"" thriller and blend it with a sort of dry irony. It's like they bite the hand that feeds whilst praising said genre influences to the rafters, but it works as damn fine entertainment. On a narrative level Miller's Crossing molds the byzantine with the labyrinthine, keeping the complexities just on the right side of the street from that of art for arts sake.  Visually the film is superb, the",2

The film is set in 1959 at the fictional Welton Academy in Vermont (location shoot from St. Andrew's School in Middletown, Delaware). The story follows that of English teacher John Keating who uses his different method of teaching to inspire his students to be all that they can be whilst warning of the perils of conformity.  Dead Poets Society was a monster smash hit that made almost $220 million profit in Worldwide box office takings.

The plot thickens and poor old ""Ben"" finds him self more and more conflicted, Whom might he choose? Whom might he be allowed to choose? Can their secret stay just that? What, I think, keeps this stylish effort from Mike Nichols relevant fifty-odd years later is it's ability to expose the human, visceral, need for sex, for love, for ""more"" - without graphically demonstrating it!

Janet Leigh is on hand as the detective’s new bride, an American.  “Touch of Evil” (1958) was written/directed by Welles (loosely based on a book) and has a huge reputation as a B&W noir-ish cult flick.

Over the years I had loved those films of his I had seen ('Leon: The Professional', 'The Fifth Element', 'The Family' and 'Lucy'), and decided I wanted to see his earlier classic. I like the fact that Besson always has some hand in the writing, and the exquisite and graceful small part he wrote for acting legend Jeanne Moreau, virtually a microcosm of everything splendid she had ever brought to the screen. Besson has a very good feel for the genres his films represent--he plays to his strengths, and is not afraid to stick to his guns (for example, I'm glad he chose the ending that he did). The two significant extras on my DVD, remarking on the making of the film, and the sound selections by scorer Eric Serra, were both informative and entertaining, and added significant va",2

1251,8 1/2 (1963),Drama,"Widely touted as one of the all-time great works of cinema, Federico Fellini’s 8½ is an elusive film about even more elusive things. It’s a meaningfully chaotic picture about trying to distil meaning from chaos and it’s a creative success about creative failure. It chronicles the resonant moments in one man’s life and admits that it can’t quite clarify why they matter. Doing justice to its early working title of The Beautiful Confusion, 8½ is a daring high wire act and an outstanding technical achievement that channels its story of artistic crisis into something sweepingly, uniquely profound.  Working again under Fellini’s direction after his winning performance in La Dolce Vita, Marcello Mastroianni plays Guido, a creatively blocked director feeling constantly distracted from the development of his latest semi-autobiographical work.

From the characterisations (suspicious femmes - mouthy coppers - sleazy kingpin - tough protagonist in a whirlpool of unravelling layers), to the hard boiled script, violence, sex and brutal revelations, it's a noir essential that only lacks chiaroscuro and expressionistic swirls to seal the complete deal.  Alleg",3

I wanted something very special to be my 5,000th film (at least to my horrible memory and to my stats on IMDb), and so after brazen and intense thought, I decided on a later-than-expected watch of a classic from Bogart's association with John Huston. I say later than expected because I bought the immaculate 24-film Humphrey Bogart Collection, which was supposed to have it on its 12 double-sided DVDs, but it accidentally had, in its place, the special features disc, which held excellent feature-length documentaries on both John Huston and the making of the film.

After some half-hearted and half-hearted attempts, he ends up turning the situation around in a surprising way.  It's a film that has the advantage of being funny, although it's still as stupid as any other teen film. They treat that snowy hill as if it were a Himalayan peak – they even gave it a name alluding to a real mountain in this range – and good skiing seems to be an obsession for the locals.

With director Cimino's recent death and his reputation in tatters since the debacle of 'Heaven's Gate', I decided to visit 'The Deer Hunter'.

Intelligently directing his crew and cast, he managed to make a discreet, unpretentious but very enjoyable film that easily wins over the audience. Still, it's bland and tepid, and perhaps that's precisely why it ended up as forgotten as it is.  One of the strongest points is clearly the cast, headed by two solid and talented actresses: Kathy Bates and Jessica Tandy. None of them are big names within the film industry, nor do they draw crowds to a “multiplex” simply by appearing on a poster.

Katsuhiro Otomo has crafted an animated sci-fi actioner for adults that's good, great in fact, a rarity since the vast majority of ""adult"" animation fails miserably by relying on dopey sex jokes and idiotic plot rather than solid storytelling and likable characters. Otomo's film weaves together themes of friendship, honor, betrayal, the deadly consequences of playing God, gang war, espionage, corruption, and the abuse of power while maintaining a breakneck pace throughout its running time.

Obviously, being Jarmusch, these stories touch on a lot of the more human side of common characters.  Regarding the stories told in the film, we can summarize them in a message that will not please taxi drivers: in this film, they drive terribly badly and are unlikely to prove competent in their work. The story set in Los Angeles is perhaps the most uninteresting because, in fact, nothing happens except the taxi ride.

In doing so, he persecutes Jewish people, including a former veteran of World War I who is now a barber (also Chaplin).  Unsurprisingly, the film was a hit on release, resonating well with the anti-Nazi sentiment in both American and British public.

Where to start with this wonderfully evocative interpretation of seven timeless pieces of classical music that accompany perhaps not Disney's most detailed, but still wonderful animations. It is essentially a series of short stories - each as different from the other as you can imagine. I think that's the most important principle when enjoying this - you must use your imagination. The representations try, with varying degrees of success, to put more defined, ambiguous and occasionally abstract imagery alongside the music - some with humour (frequently using animals, birds, insects etc.) through to far more sinister and challenging imagery, that at times reminded me of something Fritz Lang might have produced in the 1920s.

Perhaps very few, besides the producers and cast, really believed in it: it didn't receive much attention from studios and theaters, it was a huge success in Asia but was ridiculed in the USA, while Europe seems to have ignored it.  The film has a very good, but small, cast: Christopher Reeve was still reaping the rewards of the success of “Superman”, but that didn't stop him from putting in a lot of effort into this smaller work.

A Panavision/De Luxe production with music by Burt Bacharach and cinematography by Conrad Hall.  Not exactly a hit with the critics of the time, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid had no such problems at the box office or with longevity of popularity. It is still today one of the few Western films that none Western fans enjoy immensely. Much of this can be attributed to the wonderful buddy buddy chemistry between Newman and Redford, and of course the general blending of ragamuffin drama with cheeky chappy comedy.  The casting as finished was not exactly set in stone, Newman was always in but was originally going to play the part of Sundance.

This third entry has only one creature, but unfortunately it's just as gormless. When Ripley (Weaver) crash-lands on a prison planet full of hard-nut slap-heads, they haven't seen a woman in years. Discovering that there's an alien loose, Ripley asks the warden to break out the guns, and can't believe it when she is told there aren't any. Nor can we.

Quite often when film makers try to laugh as they bite the hand that feeds them they fall flat on their faces, not so here. Ok! It’s hardly genius film making but the makers instil their picture with interesting killings, twists and turns, and even an audacious narrative that would only be appreciated some years later. Horror movie conventions are adhered to with tongue stuck in bloody cheek, none more so than with an ending that will infuriate some, but conversely will bring on the chortles in others. 7/10 Fun horror movie that is on the predictable side but I still found it pretty entertaining.

Things get worse when he discovers they want his son for a human sacrifice.  Helen Shaver plays his landlord and possible romantic interest.  “The Believers” (1987) is an adult-oriented crime drama that gets increasingly horrific. The plot and tone are akin to “Wolfen” (1981), albeit with the brujería cult replacing the super-wolves. It’s leagues superior to the similar “The Serpent and the Rainbow” (1988).  The diabolic angle makes for some ugliness (e.g. death due to electric shock, suicides, grisly sacrifices, snakes and creepy arachnids), but there are rays of light as well.

My only criticism is that Steve is clearly an adult male and not a teenager or youngster.

Some brief nudity and a HOT scene with Winona as she runs though the garden in her PJ's. Not only do I gave Bram Stoker's Dracula 5 stars, BUT I rate it in my Top 10 all-time. MUST SEE! The script is an unevenly good adaptation of the novel. It resolves better Dracula's aims and motivations through the love story.  Also, it provides a more understandable glue to join the 4 men chasing Dracula from a XXth century point of view and removes unimportant characters having a more ""round"" story.  However, due to some changes certain parts are now incoherent since they were not properly adapted ",5

This is a cracking tale of science fiction, horror and even romance as the monster ends up endowed with far more ""humanity"" than either scientist. Una O'Connor and Elsa Lanchester are both great too, though feature sparingly. The special effects stand better scrutiny than many a sci-film being made twenty years later and the cannibalised classical musical score brings tension, joy, love and despair a-plenty to compensate for, admittedly a rather stilted script.

Martin Scorsese’s Cape Fear tells the story of a brutal rapist who waited for so long just to be able to avenge his wrath towards Attorney Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) for he believed that Bowden could have done much better in defending for his case.

Carrie is an undisputed horror masterpiece. I still...get chills. Sissy Spacek is really good in this as the socially inept, psychologically tortured, girl living in the shadow of her overbearingly Christian mother, with few friends and some remarkable telekinetic powers. What ensues is a complex, at times convoluted, angst-ridden horror film that sees the best and worst of human nature - of all ages - depicted, as thoughtless pranks and humiliation become the order of the day with some chilling consequences.

The idea is absurd and fantastical, but ""Cat People"" takes the subject absolutely seriously. John Heard plays a zoo manager who falls in love with Kinski’s character, while Annette O'Toole plays the third person in the romantic triangle.  The movie’s engrossing and has style & pizazz. For instance, the flashback scenes of the ancient panther tribe doing rituals in an orange desert are surreal and captivating; the accompanying atmospheric music by Giorgio Moroder adds to the mood nicely, along with David Bowie’s theme song.

This film focuses on Danny DeVito's Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman over Batman, making Michael Keaton feel like the supporting cast to Pfeiffer and DeVito. As disappointing as that may sound, Pfeiffer took this over-the-top campy Catwoman and delivered a truly iconic performance, and DeVito performed much the same in his role.

The events take place in central Texas (Cross Plains and Brownwood) during the last two years of Howard’s life, 1934-1936, and are based on Novalyne’s  memoirs “One Who Walked Alone” and “Day of the Stranger: Further Memories of Robert E. Howard.” Ann Wedgeworth is on hand as Robert’s sickly mother.  Howard’s great imagination and expertise with words made him “the greatest pulp fiction writer in the whole wide world,” as he was known. Unfortunately he died way too young at the age of 30 but, thankfully, he was prolific and so we have a lot of material by him to enjoy. It has always been a mystery to me why this talented man died the way he did, b",1

Madonna is not much of an actress and though her voice manages the songs well enough, her on-screen persona here just falls flat. She is not helped much by a poorly cast Jonathan Pryce as her president - and frankly rather insipid - husband and by the terribly wooden Jimmy Nail as journeyman singer ""Magaldi"". Perhaps only Antonio Banderas salvages anything from his authentic characterisation of the narrator ""Ché"" - but otherwise this is a good looking but lacklustre, episodically constructed, series of musical set-pieces that creates an overall feeling of - well, emptiness. Madonna's efforts fail to ignite any sense of the magnetism of this astonishing woman who went from brothel to Presidential palace in such a short time; it p",1

Agutter was only 16 during shooting while her character is 14, according to Roeg.  The themes about the beauty of nature vs. man-made desecration and the clash of the primitive with the ‘cultured’ & the problems of communication thereof were probably fresh at the time but are obvious and old hat now. ""Dances With Wolves"" tackled the same issues almost 20 years later. Still, this is an artistic piece with loads of awesome nature footage, plus it’s interesting to see Agutter so young in the bush.

Still, the story (basically a James Bond-type role, as he is forced by his boss to help the CIA prevent a Russian nuclear device from getting into the wrong hands) stands on its own, and is thrilling from start to finish, though something tends to be different and missing from his earlier Hong Kong exploits (though this was made there and dubbed--albeit horrendously--to help make him a star Stateside).

Hear me out.  For most of my watch, I was expecting to give this a less than positive rating. It starts off decently before meandering towards its conclusion. When it gets there, though, it's absolutely bonkers. My feelings towards the final part switched completely, I initially found it stupid (which it probably is) but the last embers of it are so ridiculous that it's actually entertaining.  Don't be fooled by the covers for this film, by the way. It looks like it's going to be a CGI cat but it isn't, a real cat is used for the vast majority as far as I could tell. Even on Disney+ it has the CG cover, which cheapens the film and would've turned me away - had I not been on this Disney marathon that I'm on.

It does go through peaks and troughs, there are some uninteresting moments but by and large what I was viewing was passable entertainment. The Vegas setting and shenanigans keep it watchable, the dam scenes are good too.  Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are back yet again, as is Randy Quaid. I still don't really rate the latter's character all that much, pretty annoying in fact (and not in the intended sense); Chase's Clark is supposed to be <i>the</i> idiot here, so always feels odd to have an even bigger idiot.  The more sentimental conclusion doesn't totally land, at least in terms of how it's portrayed.

But then, as I wrote, I really do not see this as a Simon Templar movie anyway so. Elisabeth Shue is totally unbelievable as a scientist. I know they had to pick someone reasonably good-looking to satisfy the script but still, she just doesn’t cut it as a scientist. The Russians are giving a much better performance.

What other mind--out of 7 billion possibilities--could have come up with this, the combining of erotic pleasure with car crashing? He sure must have been an interesting catch in his early dating years, for the adventurous women out there... I don't have a whole lot of experience with David Cronenberg's films and this is the first of his I've watched in a long time. Pretty obvious with the symbolism he was after but this isn't something I particularly engaged with despite the committed performances from the cast, although Elias Koteas was creepy good.

Good biopic with great performances from Jennifer Lopez and Edward James Olmos. The direction, however, is the film's shortcomings that was a bit shoddy at times, though seems like the concert recreations were alright.

It was one of the great successes of the time (except for the United Kingdom, shaken by the death of Diana Spencer, and where the film only later, on physical support, came to gain popularity). It is one of the most popular comedies of the late 20th century and was instrumental in consolidating and expanding Mike Myers' career. However, I don't think it's exactly… my cup of tea.

They are a loving couple and seem perfectly content with life.

Now he isn't a bad man in any malevolent sense, he genuinely loves his wife and makes it clear to his new friend that she will always take priority - a situation that ""Émilie"" appears to be quite willing to accept - albeit reservedly. Thing is, on a family picnic he decides that it's only fair that his wife know the truth. On the face of it, at least that's an half way honest thing to do but, well you'll have to watch and see.

For those not in the know, Kull was author Robert E. Howard’s other barbarian hero, who wasn’t as popular as Conan. Kull, incidentally, existed thousands of years before Conan’s Hyborian Age. The switch didn’t really matter because the script was loosely based on Howard’s Conan story ""The Phoenix on the Sword,"" which was a rewrite of the Kull yarn “By this Axe I Rule.”  Sorbo was in his",2

1609,187 (1997),Drama,"This features a strong effort from Samuel L. Jackson but is really quite a depressing film to watch. He is ""Garfield"" - a teacher who survived a vicious knife attack at his previous school in New York, but who is still determined to persevere and so moves to another in Los Angeles. The teenage kids there are a pretty disparate bunch, not really interested in education and certainly not interested in authority. Except, maybe, ""Rita"" (Karina Arroyave) who wants to succeed despite the pressures from her peers. From the outset, ""Garfield"" has a challenger in the young ""Cesar"" (Clifton Collins Jr) and most of the film is spent teeing up the ultimate denouement between the two men, in what is really a rather unfulfilling fashion.

If we could push the boundaries of our reality, what are the odds that we'd face what Truman faced in the end?  It was a joy to watch **""Jim Carrey""** as **""Truman""**, it is yet another proof that Jim isn't just a comedian. Truman...One of my favourite films. It's just hilarious. The whole concept that this man thinks he is living in the real world.  Very well done to the Director and Writers! On the surface, The Truman Show is about a man who has lived his life trapped inside of a bubble. He tries the entire movie to pop the bubble, and he event",5

She's married to a politician (John Standing) who has jilted her for luncheon on this important day, so she sets off to buy some flowers then returns to find she has an unexpected visitor. ""Peter"" (Michael Kitchen) and she have some history, and as the day unfolds we learn a little of just how that played out thanks to some flashbacks with Alan Cox and Natascha McElhone as their younger selves. These depict the build up to decisions and choices that maybe one, or both, wish now had been made differently. We are also offered a softly dramatised glimpse of the political environment that prevailed in Britain shortly after the end of the Great War. The landed gentry now struggling to maintain their previous degrees of influence, the increasing role of women - the changing political landscape, the end of deference are all woven into the fabric as the party looms and it's hostesss stresse",2

This was a loose remake of the film “The Day of the Jackal” (1973), which was based on the 1971 novel by Frederick Forsyth.  The first act is too convoluted for my tastes as the story globetrots from Moscow to Helsinki to Canada to the USA. But the movie finds its footing and settles into an entertaining political action flick not far removed from the tone of “The Saint” with Val Kilmer, released the same year. Both films are from the same genre, have the same tone, were made for the same amount ($60 million), feature an antagonist who’s a master-of-disguise and are nam",3

When Rasputin is cast aside by the Russian Imperial family, he brings down a curse on their heads that results in revolution, murder and mayhem. Shortly afterwards, a young girl is walking past a boarded-up palace one chilly evening and she breaks in. That's when she encounters the sheltering young ""Dimitri"" and his cohort ""Vladimir"". The former man takes a bit of a shine to the young girl, and after a few glances at some of the portraiture adorning the walls, concludes that she could be the eponymous Grand Duchess and their ticket to riches in Paris.

This time it's a space station with space pirates and a cloned Ripley (Siggy Weaver of course) - yes! A cloned Ripley, only this time she's devoid of human compassion - kind of... The gore quota is significantly upped, which makes for some serious sci-fi terror, and some of the imagery crafted is outstanding (a clone lab sequence is shatteringly unforgettable). A tip top cast featuring Ron Perlman, Michael Wincott, Brad Dourif, Dan Hedaya and Winona Ryder, all give good shows, whilst the photography (Darius Khondji/Se7en) and art design (Steve Cooper, Andrew Neskoromny and John M.

A timely intervention from the US Navy rescued some of the crew, but then subjected the erstwhile cargo to an humiliating and debase battle for their ""ownership"". Roger Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey) takes up the cudgels on their behalf - at no small risk to himself, and with the assistance of former US President John Quincy Adams (Sir Anthony Hopkins) takes this principle all the way to the Supreme Court. It is most bizarre to watch this and even begin to contemplate a society in which the concept of one person, business, or nation claiming the possession of a human being is actually being discussed by rational people in a court of law, but here we have it.

Wherever Sonny goes, he can't seem to part with his ""calling"" and ""anointing"" – to lead people to the LORD and motivate believers.  If you can't handle Pentecostalism and all that goes with it – lively praise & worship, charismatic gifts, evangelism and prayer – I suggest staying far away from ""The Apostle.""

Adding to his woes is a nervousness about an impending honour from his alma mater (from where he was unceremoniously expelled) and the fact that his personal life makes Henry VIII's look like ""Bertie and Elizabeth"". Of course, ""Harry"" is seeing a therapist (Robert Harper) and with just a day before his conferment, he realises that his entire shambolic life is a result of his inability to fall in love. He likes women, he likes sex but he doesn't really like commitment, wanting always to treat a relationship like something he can buy in, or return to, Walmart. That's the basis of this story of a flawed individual that using a series of statically directed sit-com style scenarios takes us thorough twenty-four hours in the manic life of the shallow and unlikeable individual.

It all relies on the rather annoying performance of Robin Williams in the role of the madcap scientist ""Prof. Brainard"" who is determined to save his college from closure by coming up with a miracle invention. His woes don't just stop there, though. His fiancée ""Sara"" (Marcia Gay Harden) might just be seeing another man!

It’s quite rare to see a film where the leading role is a female.

What a thing of beauty 🤣. The Wedding Singer marks the first Adam Sandler/Drew Barrymore team-up, and it's a wonderfully goofy and fun film. Once again, Sandler's buddies come together to play some outrageous characters, making a simple plot all the more entertaining. Barrymore seems to innately understand how to fit into the ridiculous world of an Adam Sandler movie and slightly ground the film while bringing her charm and comedy. The Wedding Singer will put a smile on your face from start to finish as Sandler's Robbie Hart warms your heart and makes you laugh with his craziness when he flies off the handle. Like any Sandler movie, The Wedding Singer ultimately focuses on love, family, and friends above all, making it an endearing entry in the Adam Sandler catalog of wacky rom-coms. This is a quite a jolly rom-com with Adam Sandler as a rather che",2

Luckily, the initial in-your-face character establishment settles down and the somewhat preposterous plot takes over quite quickly.

David Schwimmer plays the woman's fiancé while Jacqueline Obradors is on hand as the dalliance of the pilot.  ""Six Days Seven Nights"" (1998) is a lost-on-a-deserted-island adventure/romance sometimes compared to ""The African Queen"" (1951) for obvious reasons, but ""Six Days"" seems more farcical.

The plot is pretty fascinating, even if it isn't as dark or in-depth as it could be.  Ming-Na Wen gives a more than acceptable performance in the lead role. Eddie Murphy, though, is definitely the most memorable voice from this.

None of the other cast standout, yet still give what's required.  Animation-wise it's nice, while a few of the songs are catchy. I don't, as already alluded to with Murphy's Mushu, overly rate the character design.

The style is akin to movies like “Days of Heaven” (1978), “The Secret Garden” (1993) and “The Virgin Suicides” (1999). If you like those movies you’ll appreciate this one. While not as compelling as Weir’s future “Dead Poets Society” (1989), there are some obvious parallels.

This episodically styled melodrama, for that is largely what it is, straddles the periods of British history from the late 1800s, through the fairly seismic death of Queen Victoria, the ensuing gentile Edwardian era until the clouds of war gather in the early 1910s testing everyone's mettle and finally to the aftermath of the Great War. It proves to be quite an interesting observation of deference and class, of aspiration and resentment - and both O'Connor and Wynyard play their parts well.

Okay, honestly I have a good twenty favorite movies.  But this one ranks above them all.  Why?  Because I love the feel, the message, the theme inherent in the plot.  Put very simply, it is this: life is too short to waste it in the pursuit of wealth, which ultimately brings no happiness.  It makes infinitely more sense to spend it bringing joy into your own life, and the lives of those around you.  Why, you might ask, do you need to spend over two hours watching a movie just to hear this idea reiterated?

1935,How Green Was My Valley (1941),Drama,"Made at the start of WWII, there is something especially potent about this simple story of a Victorian family of Welsh miners.

Their wages begin to be cut, the job-for-life that they thought they had started to look much less certain. Much to the chagrin of the older man, they are instrumental in calling a strike and that begins a story that challenges and redefines their social and cultural norms.

I do like when movies follow characters across an extended amount of time, in this case we see events stretch across 25 years; seeing characters grow and develop as they age is a cool thing.  Morgan Freeman is terrific, as is Jessica Tandy. Dan Aykroyd and Esther Rolle play their part too. Hans Zimmer is on music and to be honest (as much as I rate that guy) I'm not convinced the score, which is good, fits particularly well here.

Natural causes.  Repo Man has become one of those films where even though it was savaged by many critics of the time (not Ebert, he loved it), was met with very poor box office as well, but now everyone seems to shout that they loved it back then, always have! It is the very definition of a ""cult movie"", a pic that went underground and found its audience, so much so it burst back above ground and today is still being discovered by an ever intrigued movie loving audience.  Repo Man was one of a kind, a film that refused to be pigeon holed, a true original.

The film's charm is sure to intrigue you.  The film’s champagne fizz and sharp repartee conceal a darker undercurrent. Characters like the sardonic Nick, a disillusioned heir to a fortune, and brooding Charlie, a struggling artist from a wealthy family, exude a cool cynicism that hints at Patrick Bateman-esque disaffection, making one wonder if Brett Easton Ellis found inspiration here for _American Psycho’s_ chilling socialites.  While some scenes flirt with overindulgence, _Metropolitan_ still cuts through with moments of incisive charm.

It was unfortunate to be the sequel to a landmark horror film, a film that birthed one of the ultimate horror icons whilst having at its core a terrifying premise. A premise that was superbly executed by all involved in the first film. Part 2 bravely tried to advance the bogeyman story to another level, to one of possession, which in hindsight was a mistake.  There's also the mixed tonal flow and confused intents that hamper the pic. Whilst the young members of the cast are too blank to garner the required amount of sympathy to get us to care about their plight, especially lead lad Mark Patton as Jesse Walsh.

1974,Friday the 13th (1980),Horror,"Clearly, the team behind “Friday the 13th” expected at least to make a reasonable profit out of it, but I seriously doubt that anyone involved in the making of this film even considered the possibility of it becoming the cult classic that it is today. Victor Miller, who wrote the story, openly admitted that he was riding off the success of Halloween (1978). The late actress Betsy Palmer even claimed that, after reading the script, she thought the story was trash (well… she actually used another word), but she took the job because she needed a new car. Little did she know when she took the role that her character would immortalize her as one of the biggest horror icons of all times.  Yes, it is evident that Victor Miller and Don Mancini capitalized on the success of Halloween (1978), but the truth is that “Friday the 13th” manages to stand out on its own, and in the end, other than being two slasher films about a killer who prowls around murdering teenagers; these two films don’t real",5

The movie debuted 2.5 months after “Friday the 13th” and less than 21 months after “Halloween.”   While it’s the least of these as far as polished filmmaking goes, it’s not far off and scores better on the female front than all of them except “Friday the 13th.” It’s basically a coming-of-age flick focusing on high school in the Great L",1
1988,Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II (1987),Horror,"***More kinetic and imaginative than the dramatic original***  A hedonistic prom queen is accidentally killed on stage in 1957. When her spirit is inadvertently released thirty years later, she wreaks havoc on prom night seeking to be queen again, not to mention obtaining revenge. Michael Ironside plays the principal of the school, the man responsible for the girl’s death decades earlier.  Sometimes subtitled “Hello Mary Lou,” “Prom Night II” (1987) is disconnected from the original 1980 film with Jamie Lee Curtis, although there are some trivial links. This one discards the disco dancing while upping the ante with the “Carrie” (1976) elements and mixing in components from the first two “A Nightmare on Elm Street” flicks (1984/1985), like the illusions and possession.  The original was more of a coming-of-age drama/whodunit with a masked assailant appearing in the last act whereas this sequel is actually a little better in that it adds creative horror pizazz, which some might say",1

1990,Prom Night IV: Deliver Us From Evil (1992),Horror,"***Four teens go to a cabin-in-the-woods to party (no, really)***  Released in early 1992, “Prom Night IV: Deliver Us from Evil” is a slasher about a psycho priest who manifests stigmata and has a penchant for slaying fornicating teens. He escapes diocese custody in 1991 and returns to St. Basil Seminar, which has been converted into a vacation home. The only problem is that two teen couples have decided to have an alternative-to-the-prom celebration there.  The only two installments from the Prom Night series that are directly related are parts II and III, both of which involve the malevolent spirit of Mary Lou Maloney. Part I features a masked assailant and this one a crazy priest, who’s reminiscent of Marvel’s Foolkiller, which debuted some 18-19 years earlier. In any case, all four films (not including 2008’s “Prom Night”) are connected in that they begin with the 1957 prom at Hamilton High School, near Cleveland, Ohio (this location is clearly established in the original film,",2
1991,Child's Play (1988),Horror,"I'm a big fan of the _Chucky_ franchise. Throughout all of its ups and downs, Don Mancini and the gang have never failed to bring forward a watchable movie. Even the most recent entry, _Cult of Chucky_ (which was kind of a fuck-up) provided me great enjoyment as a series-long fan. But no subsequent movie has ever matched the original for me. That first _Child's Play_ didn't just birth a classic character, it is, in and of itself, a classic. The first time you see Chucky open his mouth and hear the words of the real Brad Douriff... I've seen it twenty times over, and I'm still floored every single one of them. Absolutely floored, and floored with a massive grin on my face to boot.  _Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it.

And even if it is a step down from the first _Child's Play_, getting to watch new characters experience their ""I was so wrong I died"" moments is always a cause for glee.  _Final rating:★★★ - I liked it.

I saw it on a 4:3 set on a very old DVD in my parents' bedroom, after my mom had recently come home from the hospital after surgery. One night, my dad came home from the library with some DVDs, and one of them was _Poltergeist_. I popped it into the DVD player without hesitation as I'd wanted to see it since I was 5.

A slow and intelligent film with strong performances - yet also a mostly disappointing one for those who dare to go beyond the hype and actually _experience_ it for the first time.   For a film that _does_ succeed in frightening the audience and with none of the hype - I recommend The Changeling starring George C Scott.

Of course, the script is extremely talky and lifeless--as if it had been 'exorcised' of all the wonder and shock that William Friedkin's vision of the battle of good vs. evil would entail. Yes, Sir Richard Burton was a great actor--yet when shoehorned with a crappy script and with his more irritating peccadillos left unrestrained, he can be such a chore and bore to watch. Though I have not seen the two more recent 'prequels' for the 'Exorcist' franchise, I can safely say that while 'Exorcist II' is not the worst horror movie ever made (that, by the way, never seemed its intention), it's certainly the worst of the original trilogy--and by a country mile.

As the story evolves, we are introduced to the characters who ended up being his apostles and we uncover more of a man who is constantly facing temptation - of the spirit and of the flesh - at the hands of a father who seems determined to test the very fabric of his son's essence.

Bruce Greenwood is on hand as a dubious school psychologist.     The set-up of “Disturbing Behavior” (1998) is similar to the same in “Twilight” (2008), but there are no vampires and werewolves. I won’t say more about the plot, except that it includes elements of Dr. Frankenstein and “The Stepford Wives” (1975). This isn’t really giving much away as the movie telegraphs everything from the get-go and so is kind of predictable.   Yet the Great Northwest locations are spectacular, the cast is good, particularly Marsden and Stahl, and the story is compelling ",1

2028,Saving Private Ryan (1998),Action|Drama|War,"Great WWII war action in France, but too much of the drama is weak  RELEASED IN 1998 and directed by Steven Spielberg, ""Saving Private Ryan"" (SPR) is about the Normandy invasion and its immediate aftermath from June 6-16, 1944. The focus is on a Captain (Tom Hanks) and his men who are commissioned to find a paratrooper (Matt Damon) whose brothers have been killed in action.  No one's supposed to say anything bad about SPR. To do so is considered sacrilege, but I have to be honest about what I like and don't like about Spielberg's popular WWII war flick. The initial beach landing (shot at Curracloe Beach, Ballinesker, Ireland) is outstanding, as is the closing half-hour battle at the crumbling village of Ramelle.  In between these two great bookends are a few quality sequences, but I didn't find a lot of the drama all that engaging or convincing.

The writing to set up the events of this film is poor, it's incredibly manufactured.  However, as with most of these sorta films, it does produce enjoyable moments. That's helped by the casting, which Disney pick masterfully the vast majority of the time. Dean Jones always elevates a production upward, even if his performance here isn't one of his best. Tony Roberts is decent as Fred, though none of the others do all that much; not even Joe Flynn (Finley).  Nothing out of this world, but a good enough watch nonetheless.",1

It's all enjoyable enough, it's a cool and amusing concept. The first act is good.  However, after a middling middle act it then produces a relatively terrible third act - with unnecessary focus put on the characters of Joe Flynn (Francis) and Wally Cox (Mertons). They definitely didn't know how to end this, the final lot of scenes are so pointless and predictable. That's a shame, as the opening chunk of the film is more than up to scratch.  Russell gives another acceptable performance, Flynn is actually pretty solid when his character isn't shoehorned upfront.

2034,"Black Hole, The (1979)",Sci-Fi,"A little like the ""Godi"" in ""Island at the Top of the World"" I vividly recall the first time that I set eyes on ""Maximilian"" the menacing robot in this far darker Disney film from 1979. The ""Palomino"" discovers the long lost ""Cygnus"" on the precipice of a black hole and they board her. Once there, they discover that the captain - an excellently eerie Maximilian Schell (""Reinhardt"") and our aforementioned robot are determined to take their ship through the spatial anomaly. Soon, though, our visitors discover there is something far more sinister going on and it becomes a test of wits as they and their own - rather more friendly - robots try to escape in one piece. It is not a film seen too often nowadays which is a shame; it shows that back then, Disney could on occasion do more ""adult"" films with good SFX, a decent, intelligent, script and a cast - including Anthony Perkins, Joseph Bottoms, Ernest Borgnine with something to get their teeth into and Roddy McDowell has good fun as the wis",1

I'm genuinely not even sure, but it's hard to doubt that it does suitably entertain.  It constantly hops between cringe/chucklesome and overacted/finely acted. The plot is mindless and impossible to take seriously, though the shenanigans that occur are mostly amusing. It would be a lot worse off without the likeable leads, that's for certain.  Peter Ustinov brings fun as Blackbeard, sometimes his acting is a little too over the top for my personal liking but he has more funny moments than lame ones. He and Dean Jones (Steve) join up well enough, as does Jones with Suzanne Pleshette (Jo Anne) - as already seen two years prior in <em>'The Ugly Dachshund'</em>.  Not what I had expected, I come away probably wanting something different from <em>'Blackbeard's Ghost'</em>.

2037,Candleshoe (1977),Adventure|Children's|Comedy,"I enjoyed this.  <em>'Candleshoe'</em> starts in a greater manner than it finishes, but the full duration is entertaining. The early scenes are, for this era of Disney live-action at least, actually quite unusual, I wasn't fully sure where the story was going at first - which is a positive. Once everything becomes clearer, it does lose the slight edge it has at the beginning.  The cast, meanwhile, are very good. Jodie Foster (Casey) gives another strong performance from her early years, while David Niven is excellent as Priory. Leo McKern is also splendid in his role as Harry. They all work together really well. Elsewhere, you have some nice music from Ron Goodwin.  My only criticism would be the end few scenes, which round off all too quickly and don't show important parts to portray how they exactly got to where they are; notably between Casey and Gwendolyn. That aside, I'd certainly recommend this. A wonderful, gentle, spin on the ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" tale with a great ens",2
2038,"Cat from Outer Space, The (1978)",Children's|Comedy|Sci-Fi,"Nice idea, just not one that's executed well at all.  <em>'The Cat from Outer Space'</em> is mundane. The concept of an alien cat invading is cool, but they choose to do it in a way that is boring - the cat, Jake, speaks via voiceover only, so there are many shots of the cat just staring whilst Ronnie Schell speaks. That just doesn't work, to get attached/become interested in a character you need emotion and/or expression... you get none of that here. I never cared for Jake, and that's coming from someone who loves cats.  Also with the plot they spend most of the time focusing on the cat helping the humans with dull things, like betting and freezing people. Quite inconsistently too, there's a number of times where the cat could solve their problem instantly but they avoid using him for some reason. It's only at the end when they, truly, tackle the overall story arc - which itself is held back by the (understandably, I guess) lame special effects.  Cast-wise it's very flat, none o",1

I wouldn't say I particularly enjoyed it, but it's a harmless 83 minutes which fills a gap if you need it to. The locations and animal stuff are decent.  The premise isn't anything you'll remember as it isn't fresh, original or majorly interesting to be honest. As for the cast, they are serviceable. I like Lucy Deakins (Susan), Collin Mothupi (Morogo) and Keith Coogan (Ted); the latter is basically Tommy Kirk, Walt Disney himself would approve of that casting I'm sure! The adult actors are actually the weakest cast members.  Not much more to note. Forgettable sure, but it's a quick watch and not irritating or anything like that.

It has been a long, up and down decade from the studio, with most falling under that category or lower.  <em>'The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes'</em> entertains to a satisfactory degree, with Kurt Russell leading brightly as Dexter. The rest of the cast aren't all that remarkable, even if there are a load of faces I recognise from other things. If I had to choose the most noteworthy, they would be Cesar Romero (Arno) & William Schallert (Quigley).  The plot is enjoyable, it's just as bonkers as you'd expect given it's in a similar vein to films like 1961's <em>'The Absent-Minded Professor'</em>.

I remember reading the book, oddly enough, when the movie came out, but didn't bother with the movie at the time. A shame, really, for I had loved Michael Crawford in the British TV series 'Doctor in the House', when I was a kid, and Oliver Reed and Barbara Carrera always offer great value to the cinephile.  Worthy of respect, especially if you have kids around. A Disney live-action movie that hasn't aged half-badly. A good, comedic Disney superhero film.  <em>'Condorman'</em> is nothing spectacular or entirely memorable, but it does produce a sufficiently fun 90 minutes. It crosses a whole host of countries, something I like when films do. With that said, in this it feels too broken up. One minute we're in Turkey, then Italy, then Monaco. It doesn't feel like the characters have travelled to me, it's too disjointed.  Michael Crawford (Woody) and Barbara Carrera (Natalia) are solid together, none of the others",2

The message(s), while still well intentioned, comes across way more forced this time - not helped by the overall samey feeling, I guess.  Emilio Estevez remains the only actor really worth mentioning, the children and villains are very forgettable in this one. Some of the plot lines don't go far either, namely with María Ellingsen's character. There are also a few missing faces from the 1992 film, including Casey (Heidi Kling); her stuff involving son Charlie (Joshua Jackson) is ignored.  It's a silly film that can have enjoyment for some.

This was a decent, Disney (to add a touch of irony) comedy just before he was going to hit a purple patch in his life with the mega-success of 'The Cosby Show'. I wish when I came across them in a London music store a few years back, that I had pulled the trigger and bought a pair of jazz albums he had made with Quincy Jones. I have a feeling they would have proved a lot more interesting than this was. I'd recommend <em>'The Devil and Max Devlin'</em>.  Of course it is slightly hampered by the fact it's a Disney film, but I feel it manages to leave a mark in what it does tackle in regards to the premise.

It comes between the regular Disney films and Disney nature films. It sets in somewhere in the Namibia and takes us with to a great adventure which is more like a documentary film than a film with a story. Actually, there was a small story, mostly on the opening and the end part and the rest of the film was a foot journey like 'The Way Back'. Based on the book of the same name about a girl and a boy who team up with a bushman to cross the Kalahari desert after their family was attacked by the poachers.  I did not know anything about it, so I expected nothing. But I thought of 'The Gods Must be Crazy', since it is not a comedy, I prepared for something new. I really liked the film, but not that much. Spectacular African landscapes, and awesome performances by everyone. I would have loved it if a few more wild animals participated in it, after all African flavour means that's what we al",2
2046,Flight of the Navigator (1986),Adventure|Children's|Sci-Fi,"Enjoyable enough.  <em>'Flight of the Navigator'</em> features an interesting concept which they bring to life rather well. It isn't anything special and it could've probably been more thrilling, but it still produces a fine 90 minutes. The special effects haven't aged amazing, yet they still suitably serve the intended purpose.  Joey Cramer is good in the lead role as David, while Paul Reubens is fairly amusing as Max. A young Sarah Jessica Parker (Carolyn) also appears. The film doesn't quite hit the intended heartfelt spots with the plot, but there is an element of care for David from me in there minorly; if only at the end.  Decent Disney. This has stood the test of time remarkably well since it was released in 1986. Aside from a rather dated synthesised soundtrack, it's still quite a fun sci-fi adventure. When ""David"" (Joey Cramer) goes to meet his brother, he slips and bangs his head. Returning home he discovers that, well it isn't his home any more. The police soon reunite",2
2047,"Gnome-Mobile, The (1967)",Children's,"Not one to take seriously, but <em>'The Gnome-Mobile'</em> is endearing and amusing.  Walter Brennan is most definitely the best part of it, playing a dual role.

If it wasn't for the opening credits, I probably wouldn't have realised it was the same actor for a fair while. The rest of the cast are passable, while there's another small but cheery role for Ed Wynn (Rufus).  The special effects haven't aged greatly, as I'd expect so I don't hold it against this 1967 production. The plot is quite bonkers, especially the odd finale. It, like <em>'The Adventures of Bullwhip Griffin'</em>, chooses comedic journey first and storytelling second - that does hamper things but it's OK if they make it work, which they mostly do.  At just 85 minutes, it's a film worth viewing at least once.",1

I did quite enjoy this. It develops a sense of menacing mischief quite engagingly over seventy five minutes with some wittily crafted scripting and some clues for all of us to follow as the future of ""Mousedom"" is at stake. The whole Victorian scenario allows the animators to capitalise on the costumes, the enquiring scientific minds of the day and, of course, the whole sense of Empire, decency and loyalty.

However, on the other hand, I have absolutely zero that I can say I liked or enjoyed about it. I'm not a major fan of musicals either, so I'd assume I'd hate this and yet I don't. It's an odd feeling, it leaves a weird impression that's for sure.  Fred MacMurray is his usual self, delivering a very solid performance. Away from him, Greer Garson (Cordelia), Tommy Steele (John) and John Davidson (Angier) are all OK.

If you have seen any of the Disney Channels terrible made for TV movies, Hocus Pocus is like a particularly bad one with some questionable language and sexual innuendo. The acting is really bad from the entire cast, which is a little surprising considering the witches (who I had always assumed you the heroes of the story, but are clearly not) are two D-List actresses (Bette Midler and Kathy Najimy) and a C-lister (Sarah Jessica Parker) who aren't exactly known for their acting abilities, but are actual professional actresses. The CG effects are bad, even considering this is a 1993 movie and the practical effects aren't even an honest effort.

2066,Out of the Past (1947),Film-Noir,"www.noiroftheweek.com   Out of the Past is the masterpiece of film noir. Combining actors, writer, director, composer and cinematographer at their peaks makes what could have easily been a forgotten B movie a great film.  The cast is just about perfect. The trifecta of Robert Mitchum, Jane Greer and Kirk Douglas isn't just a winning combination but one necessary for the film's success. Replace any of the three and the film becomes just another thriller. Mitchum as the private detective shows a slouched-over vulnerability behind an indifferent exterior that's both believable and tragic. Jane Greer is beautiful and charming. She spends most of the time looking up at Mitchum with her doe eyes - transforming the cool and laconic PI into a love sick sucker with just a bat of her eyelashes. Douglas – not yet a movie star- is rigidly confident, young enough to be Mitchum's rival and so sure of himself that it's scary.  Casting rumors had Dick Powell in the lead role at one time.

2067,Doctor Zhivago (1965),Drama|Romance|War,"David Lean has assembled an excellent cast and together with Maurice Jarre's memorable score and some sweeping cinematography from Freddie Young does considerable justice to the lengthy Pasternak tale of ""Yuri"" - a Russian physician (Omar Sharif). Alec Guinness, now a General in the Soviet army, takes on the mantle of narrator - using the expertly innocent Rita Tushingham as the conduit for the flashbacks - and gradually we discover that it's all a bit internecine at the start. ""Yuri"" falls in love with the enigmatic ""Lara"" (Julie Christie) who just happens to be the love interest for ""Komarovsky"" (Rod Steiger) who would sell his own mother, he is certainly cheating on her's. Frustrated on that front, he ends up marrying his own cousin ""Tonya"" (Geraldine Chaplin) but with the end of the Great war looming and the October Revolution subsequently reducing the country to war-torn chaos, nothing is simple as families are split asunder trying to flee the guns and bullets.

2068,Fanny and Alexander (1982),Drama,"Released in 1982 in a 5-hour version for Swedish television and cut to 180 minutes for theatrical release, <i>Fanny and Alexander</i> was meant to be Ingmar Bergman's last film. Though the great auteur lived on another 25 years and even wrote and directed some smaller projects, <i>Fanny and Alexander</i> can still be seen as a great capstone to decades of legendary cinema.  FANNY AND Alexander deals with the great two preoccupations of Bergman's career, namely the absence of God and the unbridgeable gaps between human beings, but the result is wonderfully life-affirming. Fanny and Alexander are the children of Oscar and Emilie Ekdahl, actors in Uppsala circa 1907, but the film gives a panorama of the extended Ekdahl family, presided over by grandmother Helena, uncles Gustav Adolf (a restaurateur and the film's most comedic presence) and Carl (a professor who has fallen into debt and is trapped in a loveless marriage), their wives and children, and the selfless Jewish shopkeeper Isak ",2

She hires an alcoholic man who couldn’t pay what he owed (Robert Duvall) and discovers that he’s an ex-Country star.  “Tender Mercies” (1983) is a lowkey drama set in rural Texas, reminiscent of ""Resurrection"" (1980) mixed with “Coal Miner’s Daughter” and the later “The Apostle.” While it’s better than “Resurrection,” it’s not quite as good as the other two. However, if you like subdued storytelling, like “Places in the Heart,” you might prefer it. The film was reimagined as “Crazy Heart” 26 years later with Jeff Bridges, which also features Duvall.  On the female front, Tess is winsome in a humble way while Betty Buckley is great as the ex-wife and country entertainer, Dixie.

2077,"Journey of Natty Gann, The (1985)",Adventure|Children's,"Wholesome, charming and touching. Great film.  <em>'The Journey of Natty Gann'</em> is an excellent adventure drama. This absolutely flies through its 101 minute run time, that's mostly - though not entirely - thanks to how well paced the film is. It never stays in one spot for too long, which makes it entertaining. It doesn't sacrifice any character development by doing that either.  Meredith Salenger portrays the titular character. She is fantastic, from start-to-finish. A terrific debut! A young John Cusack makes an appearance, he is good in the role of Harry. You also have Ray Wise involved as Sol. All three of those add a lot to the production, credit to 'em.

2080,Lady and the Tramp (1955),Animation|Children's|Comedy|Musical|Romance,"One of the more endearing stories Walt Disney gave his magical animation treatment to. Based on a story that originally appeared in ""Cosmopolitan"" it tells the story of a molly-coddled spaniel ""Lady"" who finds her comfortable life completely trashed by the arrival of a baby to her owners and of two clever Siamese cats that belong to ""Aunt Sarah"" in her home. Before she knows it; she has a nice new muzzle and has run away to the zoo with local grifter ""Tramp"". The dogs embark on a series of fun, sometime perilous, adventures and slowly fall in puppy-love. The characterisations are amongst the studio's best - especially the beaver, and ""Jock"" the aptly named wee Highland terrier. It is simple, if a little over-scripted, and there are great songs ""He's a Tramp"" and ""We are Siamese, if you Please"" amongst the more memorable.

Satisfying sports story, a solid message, decent humour and a serviceable cast.  Emilio Estevez is fine in the role of Gordon, he's definitely the best actor on display here.

2083,"Muppet Christmas Carol, The (1992)",Children's|Musical,"It's been a long time since I saw this film. Got to see it at the cinema today, and it brought back joyous memories!  Out of all the previous adaptations on A Christmas Carol, this version is my favorite! There are certainly one or two toe-tappers in this enjoyable Muppetisation of the immortal Charles Dickens tale of Christmas humbug and redemption. ""Gonzo"" adopts the role of the author/narrator and guides us through this (pretty heavily) abridged version of the story as Michael Caine's arch-miser ""Ebenezer Scrooge"" is visited by the three kindly spirits on Christmas morning - each trying to point to the errors of his ways and to encourage him to engage a little more with the Christmas spirit. To be honest, I am not a fan of puppets - and these ones never worked for me on television when I was young. This film does, however, deliver well. A combination of very gentle comedy, a strong and emotional story and a star who was certainly up for joining in, all combine well to offer an en",3
2084,Newsies (1992),Children's|Musical,"Enjoyed this.  I've noted before that musicals aren't my favourite (the more I watch, the more they grow on me to be honest), but I had a fun time viewing <em>'Newsies'</em>. It manages to maintain the entertainment whilst keeping strong focus on both the music and storyline, a lot of the musicals that I've seen tend to focus on the tunes first and almost forget about the plot, this doesn't. I thoroughly liked seeing the premise unfold.  Talking of song and dance, I rate the musical numbers. I wouldn't say I'll remember or revisit any of the songs but that's not really important, the fact that it all suits the onscreen stuff is what matters most. I do like ""Santa Fe"" by Christian Bale, who is excellent by the way. Best actor on display, though David Moscow (David), Bill Pullman (Bryan) and Robert Duvall (Pulitzer) are good too.  This overtakes <em>'Babes in Toyland'</em> as my standout Disney strictly live-action musical so far; not including films like <em>'Mary Poppins'</em>, w",2
2085,101 Dalmatians (1961),Animation|Children's,"It's a classic. Great for all children and adults. Not really for me but I'll watch it if the family wants too. I prefer the live version more. Walt Disney's classic film, 101 Dalmatians, may not be completely original as it is based on a previous book, but it has turned its characters into beloved favorites, especially Pongo and Purdy. The movie will make you fall in love with all the adorable puppies like Lucky, Penny, Patch, and Freckles.  The animation is superb with just the right amount of music that doesn't overwhelm the storyline but does give us the memorable song of Cruella Deville. Speaking of the villain, Cruella is an iconic and fantastically over-the-top character, with Horace and Jasper adding to the trio's incredible dynamic.  The film is a delightful experience from start to finish, a complete classic that has been a box office success and is one of Walt Disney's triumphs. Moving forward, the live-action films, 101 Dalmatians and 102 Dalmatians, are based on the ca",2
2086,One Magic Christmas (1985),Drama|Fantasy,"Absolutely bizarre.  What is the meaning of this film? Don't get me wrong, there is a positive one in there - somewhere, I think - but the core one is dodgy. I won't go into detail as I don't want to spoil anything, though in short the film is about a mother who has lost all belief in Christmas. A standard festive premise, yet this does it with a major twist. It doesn't land with me at all, it's basically a form of blackmail by the end which is wild!  Mary Steenburgen portrays mother Ginny fairly well, given the plot troubles. Ginny is incredibly, pretty much, the villain of the production, for no real reason other than disliking the current period for logical reasons. Elsewhere on the cast, you have notable roles for Harry Dean Stanton (Gideon) and Elisabeth Harnois (Abbie). Stanton, himself, is alright.  The film actually builds up nicely, before the already mentioned capitulation with the story occurs. <em>'One Magic Christmas'</em> is extremely odd!",1
2087,Peter Pan (1953),Animation|Children's|Fantasy|Musical,"Good watch, probably won't watch again, but can recommend for fans of Peter Pan that have seen other versions.  Wow, I feel as if I've never seen this movie before: this is something that happens when you learn to watch movies critically and rewatch childhood favorites.  I'm continuously enlightened to how awful Walt Disney was.  This movie is filled with insensitive nonsense, particularly to Native Americans, and the majority of the characters are just awful people, to include Peter Pan and Tinkerbell.  Wendy is the only ""pure"" character in the entire movie, and I feel as if I'm reaching there.  Tiger Lily might be a competitor, but she doesn't DO much, so it's hard to tell.  With such a wonderful premise, and Disney's level of production value, you would think this would hold up, even after 70 years, but I honestly am beginning to think this was so widely accepted for a lack of options.  Don't get me wrong, the actual story is both ""close enough"" to the original story, and we",2

This is a hot mess. 3 songs dont work... at all. Its slow, as 1980 films were. And the plot is paper thin.  But it is glorious. This movie feels like a cartoon! The casting is perfect. Williams did his own stunts in his debut, Duval is a whine-y beauty and hell; you couldnt find a cuter baby for the role of Sweat Pea. The set design is incredible - it took 7 months to build. The jokes are memorable - both spoken and visual (and there is so much happening that you only see them on repeat viewings). And the songs (except for those 3 travesties) are catchy. Finally, this has the best use of an Octopus aside from Lord of the Rings.  This was the perfect way to forget about Hamilton from this weekend trilogy. Watch this - it is cheesy messy fun. Very poor.  Safe to say, I didn't enjoy <em>'Popeye'</em> one bit - despite the presence of one Robin Williams.

2091,Return from Witch Mountain (1978),Children's|Sci-Fi,"After an intriguing first film, <em>'Return from Witch Mountain'</em> is annoyingly a sequel that chooses a lazy, formulaic evil villain storyline.  Don't get me wrong, what you get isn't anything majorly negative but it does very little to boost the production it precedes. The 1975 film ends with a revelation of something more, to the point you'd expect them to build upon it here. Sadly they don't, as we get a very bland bad guy.  Christopher Lee is notably in this, but unfortunately for him plays the aforementioned antagonist - Dr. Victor Gannon. He is joined by Bette Davis (Letha), who is equally forgettable. Kim Richards (Tia) and Ike Eisenmann (Tony) return to play the two kids, while there are decent minor roles for Jack Soo (Yokomoto) and Richard Bakalyan (Eddie).  Disappointing that they didn't continue the idea left by <em>'Escape to Witch Mountain'</em>.

That's about all I did rate from this though, with Oz itself not looking as magical as it should while the non-human characters are boring to me.  Talking of the onscreen lot, Jean Marsh as Princess Mombi is the only performance I felt entertained by - she's very good. Away from her, there's not much to note. Fairuza Balk is solid in the role of Dorothy, nothing really to say about her other than she does an OK job; considering her age. The Wheelers are kinda interesting, they do look cool.  It's a shame they don't make use of Scarecrow, Cowardly Lion and Tin Man - the latter I'm actually glad they didn't, given how awful his design was.

2097,Something Wicked This Way Comes (1983),Children's|Horror,"By the pricking of my thumbs...  Beset by production issues, Disney being horrified by the horror of the piece and etc, Something Wicked This Way Comes proved to be a most divisive picture. Yet it's actually a spooky family friendly horror yarn.  Plot sees the Pandemonium Carnival roll into a small American town and mysteriously grant the residents their wishes.

Burum, pic is far darker than what Disney envisaged at the outset. Missing the crux of Bradbury's literary bent, the makers do however put forward a thoughtful and atmospheric story, one that looks and sounds terrific with its ethereal beats.

The Flubber itself is rarely used, as they instead focus of its ""gas"". The conclusion is, like with the 1961 film, rather dull and adds little.  Fred MacMurray, to his credit, is again good in the role of Prof. Brainard. Nancy Olson (Betsy) and Keenan Wynn (Alonzo) are both involved again, while Tommy Kirk (Biff) is shoehorned into a bigger part; not sure why.  Speaking of forced characters, James Westerfield and Forrest Lewis again appear in the roles of officers Hanson & Kelly; they were, in my opinion, only funny in <em>'The Shaggy Dog'</em>, which these films evidently share the same universe with.  Surely this sequel need",1

That team pretty much carries the movie and they go through a wonderful, fun-filled adventure into a mystery of a new girl in Allen's life.  Honestly, you could probably cut out the mermaid bit and have her be a crazy foreign girl, though that sounds like a movie someone has made already.  It being a mermaid movie definitely makes some allowances, and makes the movie more memorable.  It adds in a metaphor of the importance of communication into the writing, and gives a focal point for the story to move around and become a focus in the 3rd act.

I'd expect nothing less truth be told, the point of a film - in my opinion, at least - is to make a good film - therefore truth, which most of the time is more dull, takes a backseat. I'm not saying it's impossible to mix accuracy and entertainment, but I never expect both myself. Documentaries are for accuracy, after all.  Cast-wise, I can't say any of them properly stand out.

David Warner is on hand as a mad doctor in Austria.  “The Man with Two Brains” (1983) is similar in style & humor to “The Jerk” (1979), obviously because it’s by the same director/actor team.

It starts out powerfully with a middle-aged lawyer named Mack (Kevin Kline) taking an unwise detour in L.A.; the situation turns threatening when a group of thugs harass him, but a tow truck driver comes to his aid (Danny Glover). Thus begins a relationship that positively impacts both of their lives and the those connected to them.  One subplot involves Mack's love/lust for women (like any red-blooded male). He and his wife (Mary McDonnell) are starting to experience the empty nest syndrome; he naturally veers toward an affair at work.

This is just another poorly made spoof movies to come out of the era and even with Leslie Nielsen in the lead and one of the men behind The Naked Gun series and Hot Shots (Pat Proft) writing (and directing), a lot of the jokes fall flat.

2174,Beetlejuice (1988),Comedy|Fantasy,"Inventive and Fun take on the Afterlife.  RELEASED IN 1988 and directed by Tim Burton, “Beetlejuice” chronicles the story of a couple (Alec Baldwin & Geena Davis) who accidently perish after moving to a quaint Connecticut town. They find themselves sentenced to “haunting” their former house where they try to scare the new wannabe swank couple out (Jeffrey Jones & Catherine O'Hara), but they find that their Goth daughter is more curious than scared (Winona Ryder). Michael Keaton plays the eponymous madcap “bio-exorcist” while Glenn Shadix is on hand as the new couple’s interior designer.  This was Burton’s debut on the silver screen and the first half is hilarious entertainment mixed with some interesting insights on the afterlife. The movie puts its best foot forward, but the second half isn’t as compelling and I think the title character is more annoying than amusing.      THE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 32 minutes and was shot in beautiful East Corinth, Vermont, and (studio) Culver City",5

2176,Rope (1948),Thriller,"Can't believe I'm only seeing this now. It's great. Basically a play. There couldn't have been more than 15 shots. Ending had me in tears. Shouts out Rope was the first Alfred Hitchcock/James Stewart collaboration.  They would go on to do ""Rear Window"", ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", and finally, ""Vertigo"".  This being the first, and also a kind of experimental film on Hitchcock's part, it is the weakest of the four.  Shot as a play, mainly in one room, and with only a handful of cast members, the concept of how it was done is intriguing even today.  Done in roughly a dozen takes, the only times that the camera ever cuts are when it closes in on someone's back and then angles around to the other side.  That's the tell-tale sign of the only cuts in the entire film.  John Dall's acting is commendable, in the part of the more ruthless killer, Brandon Shaw.  He's a very cool character, and feels no guilt over the brutal murder he's just committed.  James Stewart, great as he is, seemed a b",5

2178,Frenzy (1972),Thriller,"Chillingly humorous Hitchcock piece of work.  It's always great to take a revisit to Frenzy some years after your last viewing, to re-evaluate it post haste. As a proud Englishman it gives me great pleasure to see the Master back in England capturing the English time frame of London perfectly, for the film works because we really get the vibe of the place and believe in the characters who frequent the area, Hitch delivers this no problem at all.  The story stands up as genuine thriller material, some crazy fruit loop is strangling women with neck ties and the police are trailing the wrong man...Sound familiar? Well yes it is, but Hitch being Hitch, he manages to bring dashes of humour to go with the tense taut terror unfolding on the screen.  The cast do fine here, and I do believe that the fact that none of the actors are top draw names actually helps the film bring out an uneasy feel, here the interesting fleshing of the characters is one of Hitchcock's great strengths in this ",3

A swirling mysterious tale of repressed sexuality and traumatic falsehoods, Marnie to me is one of Hitch's more accomplished works.  Tippi Hedren is Marnie, a woman who is both a kleptomaniac and a pathological liar, but her problems are more deep rooted than the surface ones we see. Sean Connery is Mark Rutland, he catches Marnie out for robbing the safe at his company and we then follow the two on a journey to get to the bottom of the demons that are gnawing away at Marnie - to the point that flashes of red and the touch of Mark send her into terrified panic.  With bleak back drops and fluctuating climate conditions, Hitchcock pulls the audience into Marnie's troubled psyche, and with Hedren's perfectly tense and wrought performance fittingly snug, the film delivers the goods for a fine Hitchcoc",1

Bruno suggests a perfect crime whereby Guy can get rid of his wife without being suspected, and he convinces himself that Guy has agreed to it.  Bruno is obviously evil, but what about Guy?  Is he is respectable as he claims?   Is his wife that bad, or is Guy really a social climber who wants to be rid of his unfashionable spouse in order to acquire a trophy wife?   Does he send mix signals to Bruno because he really wants Bruno's plot to succeed?  The notion of hidden, shadowy evil is what gives this thriller its power. Tennis pro ""Haines"" (Farley Granger) is quietly travelling in the club car of a train when his neighbour ""Bruno"" (Robert Walker) strikes up a conversation.

It has been foretold that this youngster will prove to be the undoing of the reign of terror that has permeated the land, and so this task is going to be perilous to say the least.

The acting on show is right out of the top draw, the inevitable ease that DeNiro puts menace into Capone is quite impressive, whilst the fresh faced pugnacious tenacity of Andy Garcia's George Stone is something of a delightful experience. Yet that is not enough because we still need the central actors to carry the film if it is going to triumph. Connery is a given performance wise (accent aside of course, but then again who cares when the character portrayal is as sharp as it is here?) but it is Costner as Eliot Ness that shines like the star he was soon to become, it's a magic performance that manages to fuse genuine tenderness of family love with little trips to the dark side in pursuit of making good triumph over evil.  I love that the film is showing how violence and fear affects families, mother and child is ",3

I prefer the latter! Michael Wilding arrives in New South Wales looking for his fortune. He alights on ""Mr. Flusky"" (Joseph Cotton) as a likely business partner, and at a dinner discovers that he has history with his wife, the alcoholic ""Lady Henrietta"" (Ingrid Bergman). The story tries to reconcile their respective back stories with their current scenarios and the three - alongside a solid performance from Cecil Parker as the Governor - create a decent enough melodrama that isn't half bad, even if I found Bergman - her usual emotional and over-performing self - a bit pathetic after a while.",1

Alida Valli (simply Valli in the titles) is the accused, a glamorous woman who simply reeks of gold-digger right from the start and with Leo G. Carroll leading the prosecution and a wonderfully curmudgeonly Charles Laughton as the High Court judge, you sense the writing is already on the wall for the women. Peck struggles in the role, to be honest, he lacks incisiveness - he is just a bit too ""nice"". When he discovers that it's possible that she had been having an affair with then old man's valet - a dashing Louis Jourdan - he seems torn between a sense of envy (he is clearly smitten) and a desire to secure a fair hearing and at times that drags this into melodrama territory.

2203,Shadow of a Doubt (1943),Film-Noir|Thriller,"Merry Widow Murderer - Hitchcock style!  Shadow Of A Doubt was believed to have been Hitchcock's own favourite movie, the one that he was most proud of as he felt his critics hadn't got any justifiable ammunition to shoot him down with. The film stands out because it doesn't have the tongue in cheek dark humour traits that light up most of the maestro's classics. The cheeky bonus is that of having the central premise of the main protagonist being a hero of the people. His family all adore him, where he is on the surface a man that all men want to be, and it's here that Hitchcock moulds a chilling filmic arc, in fact, it's a masterstroke of filmic manipulation.  The plot involves Uncle Charlie returning to his adoring family in Santa Rosa after avoiding his apprehension for the murder of a widow. His niece Charlie treats Uncle as a hero, she worships the ground he walks on, but as the detectives close in, niece Charlie starts to piece together things and suspects herself that Uncle ",1
2204,Saboteur (1942),Thriller,"North By Northwest's parent movie.  This is one that I actually feel deserves a higher rating on internet sites, is it fair to say that this film can be called the black & white North By Northwest? since thematically it's the same so it is something of a forerunner to that great film. Simplistic plot of innocent man on the run trying to find the real culprit after he is blamed for a fire that killed his best friend. Whilst on the run he meets an array of interesting Hitchcockian characters, from spies to circus freaks and of course the delicious lady of the piece, in this case Pricilla Lane. Enough suspense to mark it out as a film from the maestro, witness a scene as the main protagonist Barry Kane is trying to split his handcuffs on the roadside, and the ending at the statue of liberty is a cracker, making this a very tidy suspenser that earns 8/10 from me.  Tidbid; Hitchcock had wanted Gary Cooper & Barbara Stanwyck for the lead roles here and although that sounds mightily great",2

Where is the Blu-ray???!!! This excellent film, Hitchcock's one and only straight romantic comedy, has its detractors. Why, because there are no murders? No white-knuckle suspense sequences? Well, I'm sorry but they are full of crap.  Honestly, did Hitchcock ever slack off on anything he did? This film satisfies on many levels, and is at the very least a funny, well-crafted and welcome addition to the genre. Hitchcock made this film in order to work with the highly talented (and drop dead gorgeous) Carole Lombard, who gives her usual great performance here. His weakness for beautiful blondes is legendary. Robert Montgomery is also very good here. Any Hitchcock enthusiast should definitely see this film.",1
2206,Suspicion (1941),Mystery|Thriller,"Could this be Cary Grant as his most benignly menacing? The story itself is really nothing particularly new - a sort of ""Gaslight"" meets ""Rebecca"" style story that sees shy young heiress ""Lina"" (Joan Fontaine) hook up with debonaire ""Johnnie"" (Grant) and after a whirlwind romance the two are wed. His friend ""Gordon"" (Nigel Bruce) appears for a visit and soon some holes begin to emerge in her new husband's backstory. Further investigation reveals that lying is not something he has much difficulty with and after a few bumps on their road and when she discovers a letter from their insurers suggesting he was trying to borrow on her life policy, she begins to fear for her own life... Hitchcock's storytelling - at times the camerawork makes us feel like a peeping Tom - and Franz Waxman's tension-laden score add loads to this strongly character driven effort. Bruce shines as the jovial gent to whom ""Lina"" takes rather a liking, Fontaine herself treads the cinematographic line between reason a",1
2207,Jamaica Inn (1939),Drama,"Charles Laughton excels as local grandee ""Sir Humphrey"" in this super adaptation of Daphné du Maurier's book. The bleak photography and huge great waves help generate a sense of the menace of the evil Cornish wreckers. They are led by Leslie Banks's malevolent ""Joss"" who is just as cruel to his wife ""Patience"" (Marie Ney) as he is to any survivors after his men seek to drive ships onto the rocks and make off with the contraband - murdering as they go. His niece ""Mary"" (Maureen O'Hara) and under-cover customs man ""Trehearne"" (Robert Newton) discover the evil antics and complicities of both ""Joss"", his puppet-master and his accomplices and the film now tells the tale of their own death-defying actions trying to bring all to justice.

Well, everything really. Dodgy cinematography, even for the time. Charle",2

She teams up with the pretty exasperating Michael Redgrave and together they try to find the old girl. Paul Lukas is the wonderfully understated doctor and Catherine Lacey has fun being the nun. There are also a few minor storylines running parallel with the search which add some humour and a little diversion as we discover that there are sinister forces at work.

2209,Young and Innocent (1937),Crime|Thriller,"Now here's a question - whatever did happen to Nova Pilbeam? She is really good in this gentle little romantic thriller from Alfred Hitchcock. A film star is murdered by her estranged husband after he gets fed up with all her affairs. Her body is found on the beach by one of her beaux ""Robert Tisdall"" (Derrick de Marney). He goes to fetch the police but is seen running from the crime and soon it is he that the police are searching for. It's at this point that it all gets a little too slapstick; he is caught; then lots of mix-ups and police incompetence before he eventually embarks on a mission to prove his innocence with the help of the aforementioned 18-year-old Pilbeam. It's not one of Hitchcock's better films but is suspenseful and tense enough at times - if somewhat let down by the ending - enough to pass 80 minutes, at any rate.",1

This doesn't quite cause the mayhem they desire so he is unwittingly, this time, involved a much more deadly action. Unbeknown to him, Scotland Yard are on to them and have planted a detective (John Loder) in the greengrocers who befriends the family. The plot unfolds slowly and tensely. Loder and (""Mrs. Verloc"") a slightly dewy-eyed Sylvia Sidney fall for each other as we go along.

Their first attempt to fulfil their mission goes awry somewhat, as they dispatch the wrong person. It is at this point their consciences start to kick in and they question the morals of their mission - particularly when they actually do discover the identity of the enemy secret agent.

Henry Kendall and Joan Barry come into a windfall inheritance and decide to celebrate by going on such an holiday - and soon discover that it isn't all it is cracked up to be. Using some of Hitchcock's expertly hones silent film skills, we tell the story as our nouveau-riche couple slowly realise that wealth isn't everything as their behaviour and attitudes start to adapt to their new surroundings.

The mixture of musical, comedy and magical turns illustrates well just quite how a real pot-pourri of acts took to the stage in theatres up and down the UK - but there is no audience. Without the engagement, even applause, from those watching the whole thing comes across as a rather sterile collection of concert performances, as if filmed in an empty television studio. It has a couple of rather tenuous continuing threads that try to hold it together - one features a fellow with an elementary television trying, unsuccessfully usually, to catch some of the performance on his set.

Without the heavy weight of expectation for a return to form for John Carpenter, it proves to be a schlocky and bloody good time.  James Woods stars as a Vatican backed vampire slayer, something he does with considerable relish. But now he is up against an uber vampire in Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), a leader with powers unbound. Daniel Baldwin and Sheryl Lee are along for the gore laden ride.  Woods is cool, with a quip on the tongue and a deadly weapon to hand, his by-play with Tim Guinee's priest provides much of the film's humour. The photography, choreography, editing and tension building are all high in quality, and while the story is weak and there's a whiff of misogyny in the mix, for a horror popcorner there's a good time to be had here. 7/10 Never been a big fan of this movie, and of vampires in general, ",2

A very good looking depiction of the early reign of England's Queen Elizabeth I with Oscar-nominated Cate Blanchett in the title role. Initially, she struggles to stay alive during the reign of her devoutly Catholic (a superbly cast Kathy Burke) half-sister Mary, with the help of her childhood friend Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes).

2338,I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998),Horror|Mystery|Thriller,"Just as good as the first in my opinion. Might be slightly better because this one has a lot more killings then the 1st. The ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" franchise has left a lasting impact on audiences, with the first film being particularly noteworthy for its thrilling and grounded portrayal of a vengeful antagonist. Ben Willis stands out as a compelling and underrated character, bringing a sense of realism to the story without delving into the supernatural realm. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. deliver captivating performances, drawing viewers in with their charisma and acting prowess.  The sequel, ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,"" takes the characters on a harrowing adventure to an island, adding another layer of suspense and terror to the franchise. While some may overlook this installment as a credible sequel, the addition of Brandy Norwood as Carla contributes to the film's appeal and intensity.  However, the franchise takes a misstep with ""I'll Alway",3

Death's deal with Parrish is that, as long as he's entertained, he'll delay Bill's death. Mr. Death materializes as a mysterious stranger with child-like qualities known as 'Joe Black.' His ""holiday"" is complicated when he falls for Parrish's daughter (Claire Forlani).  ""Meet Joe Black"" (1998) is a re-imagining of the 1934 film ""Death Takes a Holiday"" (which I've never seen).

He is joined by a naive follower (Eric Roberts) and they stow away on a train consisting of four locomotives, but the train runs away. Meanwhile, the arrogant warden (John P.

2345,Desert Bloom (1986),Drama,"_**Underrated drama about coming of age in 50's Vegas**_  ""Desert Bloom"" (1986) is an excellent and underrated coming-of-age drama about a semi-dysfunctional family living in Las Vegas in the early 50s. The military is conducting atomic bomb testing nearby. The story mostly focuses on 13 year-old Rose (Annabeth Gish) who struggles with her relationship with her stepfather, Jack (Jon Voight). Jack suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and alcoholism. Her mother, Lily (JoBeth Williams), is the pillar of the family that keeps them together and hopeful. When Lily's sexpot sister, Starr (Ellen Barkin), visits it's both a blessing and a curse.  The film grabbed my attention from the get-go, which is a good sign, and sustained it till the end.

The husband joins the mysterious all-male organization of the town which seems to be up to something fishy. Paula Prentiss is on hand as Joanna’s quirky new friend while Tina Louise plays another newbie resident.  “The Stepford Wives” (1975) is a drama/mystery that morphs into sci-fi/horror. It’s iconic for good reason. The story’s captivating and the movie’s all-around entertaining. The story's not campy at all, like the confused 2004 version. This is serious and creepy sci-fi/drama with a bit o’ satire.

But there wasn’t as much humor as I thought I remembered, and the plot of a guy trying to “rescue” a hooker seems rather stereotypical and predictable in places. It didn’t do much for me and I barely stuck with it. I was so unimpressed that I decided not to watch another gangster movie featuring Hoskins and good ratings.

I can watch it and enjoy it for what it is, a more kid-friendly version of King Kong with essentially Kong Jr. But, despite a good cast, great F/X and lots of action & adventure, the movie's somehow shallow with cardboard thin characters. When little Johnny gets stuck on the Ferris wheel, compelling Joe to rescue him, I just rolled my eyes.

None of the humour got laughs, or mild amusement, out from me - except one scene involving a toilet, which is marginally amusing. It also tries to join the comedy up with heart, especially between Martin and Tim, but it simply doesn't hit. There are moments where I could tell the film wanted me to care for the character(s) but I never did.  It's also a surprisingly horny film, with iffy innuendo and even some inappropriate touching in there. If this was an <em>'American Pie'</em> type of film then it might fit, but it feels very out of place here. Zoot (Wayne Knight) confirms those words, his dumb character is obnoxious.  Knight, who is oddly uncredited, is joined by Christopher Lloyd (Martin) and Jeff Daniels (Tim). That should be a great match, but they never really click together in my opinion - a missed opportunity, for sure. Elizabeth Hurley (Brace) ",1

It’s unique enough to stand on its own and is arguably on par with “Heathers” and the overrated “Mean Girls,” but it’s not as good as “Carrie” or its excellent sequel, “The Rage: Carrie 2,” which was released the same year.  McGowan is great as the alluring biyatch while Gayheart looks too old for the part at 27 during shooting, not to mention nigh anorexic.

It was actually written by King based on a real place and instances during a stay at a rented house. He was never quite happy with the tone of the book and only submitted it as a contractual obligation. Glad he did because it provides a very solid grounding for horror and deals with the very real horrors of overwhelming grief.  The film gets the tonal flows right, the family dynamic is neatly pitched in readiness for what is to come later, the house and the titular Pet Sematary of the title are eerie personified, and Fred Gwynne is on hand for a sage old characterisation.

One again we get a star cast list, this time thrust into mid-air peril where standard genre conventions apply. Unfortunately this is one of the weakest genre entries of the decade, where suspense is hard to find, and in fact it often comes off like unintentional comedy.

After we are introduced to an ANSA Mission Commander named Colonel Taylor, we are treated to a roller-coaster type sequence as we see the re-entry and crash of Taylor's ship subjectively; as if we were aboard her. The abandon ship scenes are still impressive even by today's standards. It's very easy to believe we are seeing a real spacecraft crashed in the water.

2551,Dead Ringers (1988),Drama|Thriller,"I've often thought that there should be beauty contests for the insides of bodies.  Dead Ringers is directed by David Cronenberg who also co-adapts the screenplay with Norman Snider from the book ""Twins"" written by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland. It stars Jeremy Irons and Genevieve Bujold. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Peter Suschitzky.  Identical twin gynaecologists Beverly and Elliott Mantle (Irons) run a high end fertility clinic in the city. Both in tune with each in spite of being different personalities, their world starts to fold inwards when Beverly falls in love with drug dependent actress Claire Niveau (Bujold).  Inspired by the real life story of gynaecologist twins Cyril and Steve Marcus (who were both found dead from suicide brought about by drug addiction), Dead Ringers is an amalgamation of unsettling horror and icy cold playfulness; in other words a perfect canvas for auteur Cronenberg to paint some of his peccadilloes.  Cronenberg doesn't need to ",3

I quite enjoyed it, but it has little of merit to recommend it; the action scenes are as lumbering as Chaney doing the cha-cha; the dialogue likewise and but for Carradine's eyes and a few scenes from George Zucco as the modern day High Priest, it would fall entirely by the wayside.",1

Sure, the younger twin sisters, Cindy & Cathy, dispute the claims of gross abuse (while admitting Joan was strict), but they were only 3 years-old when Christina was 11 and so weren’t present or were simply too young to know what went down with Christina & Christopher. Another thing to consider is that Joan learned a few lessons on parenting in raising the two older kids and therefore was wiser with her treatment of Cindy",1

Without any lines of dialogue, the filmmakers and Boris Karloff had to use actions and emotions to display the motivations of the monster, and they did a fantastic job of it. The fear, confusion, and longing that the novel describes are evident in the monster's actions, to the point of pushing the audience to root for him.  The rest of the characters are also a bit of fun. Baron Frankenstein, played by Fred Kerr, was also a hoot. He played a no-nonsense character that functioned well in the comic-relief role needed with Edward Van Sloan's Dr. Wladman and Mae Clarke's Elizabeth being quite serious, even dramatic.

Where that story and later John Carpenter's wonderful remake focused on paranoia and mistrust, this film is something of the ""polar"" opposite (literally) as regards the group in peril. It bears all the hallmarks of producer Howard Hawks, who clearly influenced Nyby's direction.

The girls are equally stunning most of the time, and just as (if not more) sexually curious - what's the beef? The script/humour plays to just about every stereotype imaginable: the sporty jocks and the dimwit broads; the parents who react to their offspring's sexual predilections as if they, themselves, had never had a shag in their lives.

This is an huge triumph for hype over content and the marketeers have done a truly remarkable job.

The attention to detail by director Stanley Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott is admirable, whilst the costumes are of the highest order. I have never read the novel by William Makepeace Thackeray so have no frame of reference as regards the portrayals we witness unfolding. I have read that many find the film lacking in the humorous wit that is rife in Thackeray's page turner, yet Kubrick's take is full of satire surrounding the social standing that is the core beat of the story - well it certainly had me smiling anyways.  The film is pretty downbeat, thus, for a three hour movie it can bog down many a viewers patience.

In any case, Allen weaves his delightfully entertaining narrative thread through all aspects of radio in his life and the results are absolutely charming and spellbinding and they showcase Allen at his best. “Joe” (Seth Green) is reminiscing about his childhood in a New York where he lived with his mum and dad and her extended family in some basic and cramped accommodation - it’s a bit like the “Bucket” household from the world of Roald Dahl, replete with cabbage soup, too.

That's not to say it deserves to stay back in that decade though, for although it hasn't aged well in context to our evolving societies, and as implausible as ""Stormy's"" legal shenanigans are, the piece serves up a nice blend of satire and legal ethic conundrums.   It's also decidedly funny, that is until John Hurt arrives as a pompous suspected ",1

Set during the period of time when Cold War and sci-fi paranoia was prevalent, The Iron Giant embraces these themes and stokes them with lessons of friendship, hatred, death and pertinent reminders of pacifism. Directed by Brad Bird and scripted by Tim McCanilies and Andy Brent Forrester, The Iron Giant is one of those rare animation animals that delights the kids as much as it does the watching adults. Though the actual giant himself, with all his dazzling weaponry, is the star attraction on show, it's the iron colossus' inner conflict that gives the film its heart. Aided by his friend, young Hogarth, good old iron decides he doesn't want to be a big weapon, but the authorities, as is nearly always the way, just can't let it be. The unflinching attitude",2

He hopes to get his hands on someone who has died of fright to test his theory and this proves simpler than one might think, thanks to the company he keeps.

Part horror, part dreamy thriller, and of course with little dashes of humour within, it all comes together rather well.

I have a special place in my heart for the religious thriller, so perhaps I'm a tad more lenient than I should be in my grading, but I could very well say that the devil made me do it, or at the very least, his spawn. Jerry Goldsmith does another fine soundtrack, albeit not with the two Oscar nominations and one win this time around, while William Holden and Lee Grant do a credible job of replacing stars Gregory Peck and Lee Remick, whom Damien had no qualms dispensing with in the first film.

The film tells it's audience that the beauty in the small details is much greater than society's typical image of beauty. The prominent rose in the film is a symbol of false, surface beauty; the expensive and romantic flower is amongst almost every single shot in the film reminding us that we need to look beyond the surface beauty of an entity and see the beauty within.

Can he retrieve it, and re-set the path of true love for the young Prince David and Princess Glory, who might offer a peaceful solution to their respective nation's enmity?

I actually saw the trailer, or preview, if you like, for Phantasm while awaiting the start of Invasion of the Body Snatchers in December of 1978. And I remember the trailer quite well, considering that the upcoming film looked scary as the word itself. The part in the trailer that really got to me was the scene in which the main antagonist, the Tall Man, played by Angus Scrimm, is standing outside of some kid's bedroom window (at night) looking in over the kid's head. It freaked me out ... Completely out. And being a horror film buff - even then at such a young age - I'd immediately said to my mother who had been sitting next to me: 'Ooh, ma, I wanna see that movie!' Phantasm looked horrifying ... And I loved horrifying movies. My mother said 'Yes'.  It would be the next year, in April of 1979, that we (only my mother and me that time) would finally see Phantasm.

I like it a little better than the prior sequel because it omits the contrived and confusing twists & turns of the second half. (But, if you seriously reflect on “Psycho II,” everything makes sense after the climatic reveal; you just have to put the pieces of the puzzle together).  Besides Scarwid, the film scores pretty well in the female department with comely redhead Juliette Cummins from “Friday the 13th Part V” (1985) and brunette Katt Shea.

The arrival of the seriously puritanical ""Davidson"" couple - Huston and wife Beulah Bondi - soon puts a cramp in her style, though. Their shock and disgust at this slatternly behaviour leads them to try to get her deported back to America (where she has a bit of a wicked past), ostensibly in a bid to save her moral soul. Crawford is super as the working girl, but not quite so effective as the truly odious Huston, who features sparingly but oh so potently as he starts spouting scripture.

""Sanjûrô"" decides to help protect them, and is soon drawn into the battle that requires all of his skills and know-how (of course, they are completely outnumbered). The plot interveaves a story of local politics nicely with a lust for power, and a coming of age for many of the locals who are in awe of their warrior leader. Takako Irie is quite interesting as the wife of the arrested Chamberlain; she looks every inch the prim and proper Japanese wife, but is frequently (and to Mifune's chagrin, on occasion) the character delivering some quite insightful and learned comment; she seems to have the measure of the Samurai!

From director David Lynch, The Straight Story finds the famous purveyor of the oblique on wonderfully mellow form. Story finds a superb Richard Farnsworth as Alvin Straight, an old boy long in the tooth who sets off across America on his lawn mower to visit his estranged brother. You see, he doesn't have a driving licence, so lawn mower is the viable form of transport.  Lynch and writers John Roach & Mary Sweeney have offered up a wry and astute observation of Americana. The journey Alvin takes involves him meeting a number of eccentrics and confused souls, which pitches Alvin as our conduit to a rich view of the life we have - or will - live. Culminating in a finale that rewards anyone with an intelligent soul. The message is clear.  A beautiful film for the beautiful of heart. 9/10 Beautifully made film.  It's a difficult one to describe. <em>'The Straight Story'</em> features a very touching, true lif",2

It stars Dustin Hoffman, Faye Dunaway, Martin Balsam, Chief Dan George and Richard Mulligan.  Arthur Penn's Little Big Man is tagged with many filmic sayings, be it revisionist or anti Western etc, it's a picture much cherished for its oddly quirky slyness. Allegorical movies are now in this day and age ten a penny, but back in 1970, with the Vietnam War in vivid focus, that wasn't the case. Marking this out as a provocative and ambitious venture.  Penn has fun debunking and poking fun at the myths of the Old West via an array of pungent characters that Jack Crabb (Hoffman) meets in his lifetime. All of which leads to the question hanging in the air, that of is Jack Crabb the sole white man survivor of Custer's last stand at Little Big Horn?  The portrayal of the Indians, here the Cheyenne, is superlative b",2

That's about the strength of the films plot, yet it makes for a very funny film that crackles with glee due to it's excellently written script. Watching the respective characters rise and fall respectively creates laughs aplenty whilst asking the question of how we all would cope in similar circumstances?  Sure the film does beat one over the head with its social message, we are in no doubt from the off about the gap between the rich and the poor, and yes the colour of a persons skin also rears its ugly head here to make this one of the more braver comedies of the 80s.

3040,Meatballs (1979),Comedy,"Amusing and harmless misadventures at summer camp with Bill Murray  Bill Murray (who was 28 during shooting) stars as an eccentrically droll camp counselor at Camp North Star who “trains” CITs, counselors-in-training, as they oversee the hordes of kids and face challenges with teams from preppy Camp Mohawk.  “Meatballs” (1979) is a fun and innocuous summer camp flick. It’s not great but it’s entertaining enough, although if I’m going to view a summer camp film I prefer the Friday the 13th movies (practically any of them), mainly because they feature superior women. Here, Cindy Girling as curvy blonde Wendy is by far the most alluring, although Sarah Torgov as Candace is decent.  In light of the license plates, the camp is presumably located in upstate New York, but was shot in Camp White Pine, Haliburton, Ontario, which is only about 125 miles from the New York border.  The movie runs 1 hour, 34 minutes.  GRADE: B/B-",1
3041,Meatballs Part II (1984),Comedy,"**_Silly sequel delivers the goods_**   Two competing camps on a lake in SoCal go through the challenges of a typical summer, except this year there’s an extraterrestrial visitation. Richard Mulligan is on hand as the director of Camp Sasquatch.  “Meatballs Part II” (1984) is all-out comedy compared to the first movie, which was a relatively realistic summer camp flick with some amusing bits. This one throws in an ET-like character along with a lot of goofiness and camp, particularly the ‘general’ of the military camp (Hamilton Camp).  Petite Tammy Taylor stands out on the feminine front as Nancy, along with voluptuous Misty Rowe (Fanny) and Kim Richards (Cheryl) with her glorious long hair. The flick is superior to the first one in this department. On the other side of the spectrum, John Mengatti is effective as the Chachi-like Flash.  While there’s some sex-oriented humor, which is to be expected given the milieu, it doesn’t go overboard into tastelessness like the next seque",1

Of the three sequels this is the only one with connections to the original 1979 film in that Rudy, the mentee of Tripper (Bill Murray), is 2-3 years older and focused on girls. Tripper doesn’t appear in this one, but Rudy reads a letter from him.  The flick is a mixture of the original “Meatballs” with the goofiness and biker gang of the beach party films of the ’60s, plus the raunchiness of “Porky’s” (1981). It’s that last part that ruins the movie for me, although it’s thankfully not AS crude. In short, this is “Meatba",1

3044,Dead Again (1991),Mystery|Romance|Thriller,"By far, my favourite film of Branagh's that he's directed. A solid mystery/thriller--the kind that's not done enough these days IMHO. Though he's certainly diversified his oeuvre recently, what with Disney remakes and even superhero films, I wish he had done a lot more like this one, rather than, high-quality as they are, a metric tonne of yet-more Shakespearean adaptations. Kenneth Branagh's first film, **HENRY V**, was a critical triumph.  But since it was a Shakespeare story, it is overlooked as high-brow. With **DEAD AGAIN** as his sophomore directorial effort, Branagh has a film for the popcorn crowd.  If **HENRY V** was tonally like a Laurence Olivier film, **DEAD AGAIN** is tonally like an Alfred Hitchcock movie. Filmed in 2 eras, in both color and black and white, with characters portraying multiple characters,  a private eye, reincarnation,  a fortune teller even a _femme fatale_ suffering from amnesia!

The screenplay is by American actress/comedian Rita Rudner and her husband Martin Bergman. They are able to bring a unique perspective to the high British environments and phobias.  To top it off, Rita also portrays the American in the film in a funny turn.  The cast each embodies their assigned personality admirably.

Actually, though, the plot is a bit more interesting. Set during WWI, Margaret Lindsay (""Helene von Lorbeer"") is sent to London, to the home of Cabinet Minister ""Arthur Bennett"" (Holmes Herbert), where she is to rendezvous with his already treacherous butler ""Valdar"" (Boris Karloff). Once there, we embark on the usual round of who to trust/not to trust storylines as they try to get hold of secret war plans. What stands it out a bit is that is has a certain propheticism about it: it isn't so much telling us the tale set in 1917, but one of the likely pitfalls of megalomania and unbridled ambition in the future; clearly a reference to events looming in 1940 when this was released. It's watchable enough, the small cast is tightly knitted and perform well; the writing does it's job fine and Terry Morse kept me interested for an hour.",1

After some frankly hilarious auditions that pitch the tone deaf straight into the arms of the fashion police, the pair manage to assemble ten folks as different as gin and Guinness. It's no easy task moulding these disparate and lively individuals into one coherent unit, but oddly enough - despite their differences - it's the music from the likes of Mack Rice (""Mustang Sally""), Al Green & Teenie Hodges and a range of established American soul songsters who manage to provide them all with a common language and purpose as they gradually start to gain some traction amongst a sceptical community and an even more cynical music business.

But things get complicated when Jim's old partner, Ted, turns up and sets his sights on Linda, Jim's gorgeous ""friend"", this holiday period may not be so happy after all.  Boasting great star power in the form of Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire, Holiday Inn still feels short of the required genre excitement. There is no doubting the benefit here of having both the leading men's respective abilities on show, where Bing croons with the best of them and Fred of course dances with majestic grace.

It's not hard to see why it was such a box office winner, sure it's a touch too long given that a lot of characters don't really have much to do, but performances are strong and the slices of humour off set some of the national stereotypes on show.  One has to marvel at the ambition of the production, Fox Studios boss Darryl F.

3063,Poison Ivy (1992),Thriller,"**_A luscious Lolita takes over the family..._**  ...that's the basic plot of 1992's ""Poison Ivy"" starring Drew Barrymore in the titular role. The movie comes from a long tradition of films about an alluring babysitter (or nanny or friend) taking control of the family by winning the hearts of the kids and seducing the husband. ""The Babysitter"" (1980) and ""Summer Girl"" (1983) are two examples, both TV flicks (available on youtube). In ""Poison Ivy"" Drew, as Ivy, plays a friend of the awkward misfit Sylvie (Sara Gilbert). Tom Skerritt plays the aloof husband and Cheryl Ladd the withering (but still beautiful) mother.  ""Poison Ivy"" is more stylized than the aforementioned examples and technically better due to a much bigger budget.

This is after all a Hollywood movie, NOT a documentary such as ""The World At War"", so we can't be too critical about perfect accuracy.  Originally it was supposed to be directed by two directors, 1 for the American story line, and Akira Kurosawa, for the Japanese story. There were rumored difficulties between Mr. Kurosawa and the American studio bosses so Mr. Kurosawa left the production despite having an uncredited role in scripting the Japanese part of the screenplay.  I have read recently that the version that was being shown, of the historical account in the movie, was different than the conventional history's perspective. However, I would say that is only in demonstrating, theatrically, how Admiral Kimmel and General Short, who were scapegoats and put through rigorous Congressional Hearings after the actual event, may have taken ample precautio",2

Even allowing for the absence of the songs (a major gripe with purists), the film is far too bloated to really achieve the heights of being a great comedy classic. If it had been condensed to perhaps a 100 minute film then I think it could have achieved the splendour that some sequences hint at. As it is though, there is still much to enjoy, and nobody should be under the impression that this film isn't funny, because it is, but just how long can you stretch the joke Mr Wilder?  I think the chief thing that sticks out is just how did Wilder get such an overtly sexual farce past the censors?

I do not think Johnny Depp was the right person for playing Ichabod Crane. Maybe I am too influenced by seeing him in Pirates of The Caribbean but I just do not think he was the right person for this role. He really did not work for me. He is to whimsical and gesticulating to be taken seriously as a scientifically inclined crime investigator as far as I am concerned.  Too bad since the story itself and the movie was quite promising. As is often the case with Tim Burton’s work the movie has quite dark tone which I quite like. The various scruffy and suspicious characters that Ichabod meets right away as he enters the village inn fits right into the eerie atmosphere.  Unfortunately Ichabod’s inclination for science clashes with the rest of the story which is undoubtedly supernatural. It makes the movie not really have a distinct direction but instead waddle with one foot in each camp. I would have preferred if the movie either had gone all science 5

To make matters worse, he has already informed them that when he gets there - he is going to kill them!. Ida Lupino directed this quite spooky drama with some skill and Edmond O'Brien and Frank Bowen play well together as the captives in what is essentially a taut three-hander. It does push the bounds of plausibility at times, though - there are opportunities to overwhelm their antagonist and after a while those begin to undermine the threat; you do begin to believe that good will out and so the tension starts to diminish quite quickly...

The script is deliberately taut and sparse, while the marrying up of the crashing waves and jagged rocks of the locale with the emotional turmoil is a deft piece of directing. The use of newcomers Belmont and Cunliffe add a potent sense of realism to the whole thing, aided no end by an intelligent screenplay that do",1

Shortly afterwards, suspicious things start going on at a country house where a mystery unfolds that leads the assembled group to try to track down a satchel with half a million bucks in it! The antics in the house are well paced and entertaining - especially the completely over the top Una Merkel ""Dale van Gorder"" who is quite literally scared by her own shadow. The lighting and settings are very stage bound, but in this instance that helps keep the production tight and engaging. The action is plentiful, if a little slapstick at times - and the ending straight out of a Laurel and Hardy film. It's worth sticking with it right to the ending though - quite an innovative invitation to the audience not to leak the identity of the ""Bat"" to their friends lest they, too, risk becoming his next victims.

Despite wallowing in a dreary pall (which ties-in to the theme), the movie conveys many insights about real life and has some genuine warmth. A couple good examples are when Sam looks at Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane (Bridges) before they leave for a wild weekend in Mexico or the final scene between Sonny and the coach’s wife (Leachman); Sam’s reflections at “the tank” is another.

This story departs pretty drastically from the original text and turns into more of a sentimental love story tempered by treasonous activities from within the King's extended family.

Hayward is well off her best here - even when she is dancing. In fact, the whole story could hardly be farther from anything imagined by Georges Bizet.

I say a study of man, but this is way more than just about him, it identifies and develops themes about inter and intra racial and gender attitudes and leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. All of that said, it does struggle as a piece of entertainment. I don't mean to trivialise the subject matter, but if it wanted to be a documentary then it should have been more tightly focused on fact and less on the dramatisation of events, some real, some not.

Like Clarence Williams III from The Mod Squad?  When a worldly singer witnesses a mob crime, the police hide her as a nun in a traditional convent where she has trouble fitting in.  Whoopi Goldberg is the sister act of the title, and boy does she have a great time with the characterisation. It's hardly pulling up any trees, and it holds few surprises, yet it's so warm and gentle with its humour it's near impossible to dislike.  The laughs obviously come from Goldberg's street wise gal trying to adapt to life in a convent. The big message that unfolds, as she gets more at ease with her surroundings, is that not only can earthy girls come to be honourable by learning new fortitudes, but also that they can positively affect those around them in a perceived stuffy environment.  The trajectory of the nunnery choir under Goldberg's tutorship - from wailing cats to cherubic angels - is the film's highlights, while Maggie Smith as the prim and proper Mother Superior is c",3

The evidence points to the hamlet being cursed with a mysterious ghost girl that compels those who see her to kill themselves, which the doctor thinks is rubbish; at first anyway. Erika Blanc plays a visiting medical student who assists Eswai while Fabienne Dali appears as the village witch and Giovanna Galletti as a bitter baroness. Luciano Catenacci is on hand as the burgomaster (mayor) and the witch’s lover.  The movie has a colorful and haunting Gothic/Horror ambiance, which can be traced to earlier films like the B&W ""The City of the Dead"" (aka ""Horror Hotel"") (1960) and, more so, “The Terror” (1963), which was one of Francis Ford Coppola’s early works, although he only directed part of it.

The cast includes notables like Mel Ferrer, Stuart Whitman, Carolyn Jones and a young Robert Englund.  Despite the presence of the croc, “Eaten Alive” (1976) is more of a slasher flick than crocogator horror (the croc is strictly peripheral, not to mention unconvincing). This was Tobe Hooper’s follow-up to his unexpected hit “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” (1974) wherein he borrows the plot of “Psycho” (1960). Unfortunately, he spectacularly fumbles the ball.   The surreal style, sets and cast are all good, but there’s a lack of confidence in the execution: The flick’s full of nonsensical actions, meanderings and padding.

I was poor for several years as a young adult and never came close to that sort of reasoning.  I am in the U.S. but I have watched a lot of British programming and movies over the years and usually manage the accents quite well, but these folks often spoke very fast and low, and I missed half or more of some conversations .

That knowledge always made the load I was carrying seem less significant, and helped me to see the light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak. Cinematically speaking, at least in the fine age of silent movies, one of the most difficult gestation periods for the birth of a great film was the highly traumatic 11 months of production for one of Sir Charles Chaplin's masterpieces, 'The Circus'.  I love both silent cinema and early filmic comedies, and though I prefer Buster Keaton to Chaplin, I always enjoy his great works, up to and including 'The Great Dictator'. Particularly close to my heart is 'The Circus'.

What occasionally draws me to these types of films is their youthful energy and fun spirit, as well as the oceanic locations and the women. It brings one back in time to the carefree era of his/her coming-of-age years. Thankfully, ""The Flamingo Kid"" shoots for something deeper than just a shallow beach flick, which the best ones do, e.g. the original “Gidget” (1959).  The story takes place in 1963 where 18-year-old Jeffrey (Matt Dillon), a plumber's son from Brooklyn, gets a summer job at a private beach club on Long Island called the El Flamingo. This was his final summer of carefree fun before going off to college, but his experiences at the club change his plans.

If you enjoy this review, please check out my blog, Old Hat Cinema, at https://oldhatcinema.medium.com/ for more reviews and other cool content.  Two Little Tramps  The most amazing thing about Charlie Chaplin’s The Kid is that it was released in January of 1921. That makes this film 100 years old! A century has gone by since it was made, released, and first viewed, and yet it’s still available to be appreciated anew today. The DVD print that I watched was in very good shape, the picture was great, and I felt that I was watching an important piece of cinema history.  However, The Kid is by no means one of my favorite Chaplin films.

He plans to cut down the mighty redwoods but a colony of homesteading Quaker-like Christians are unwavering in their resolve to save the largest of the sacred trees, which are the ones Fallon wants most. Edgar Buchanan plays Fallon’s sidekick-turned-marshal in the Redwoods, Walter ""Yukon Lucky"" Burns.   This was a remake of Warner Brother's ""Valley of the Giants"" from fifteen years earlier.

The course of true love is not going to run smoothly for this couple, even when the millionaire does actually try to own up and help out - and the constabulary are called to investigate what she is certain is a dodgy cheque!

There are a lot of struggling actresses and musicians and waitresses in movies, but writers often get fast-track succes.  Anyway, I wander off topic. I enjoyed the movie with its range of quirky characters, and minor plot twists. There are only a couple of two-dimensional characters; the rest are given depth, even a few who don’t have a lot of screen time.

After a hit goes wrong through no fault of the assassin's own, his mafia liaison Louie (John Tormey) is sympathetic, but explains that his superiors now want Ghost Dog dead. The film follows Ghost Dog's revenge and depicts a clash between two ancient tribes that both seem out of date in this modern world: Ghost Dog's samurai code and Italian mafia ideas of loyalty.  Jarmusch has always been open about the fact that he soaks up a huge number of inspirations from earlier films, books, and music and then lets them reflect in his own work. Any cinephile will instantly recognize Jean-Pierre Melville's 1967 film Le Samouraï as the point of departure for GHOST DOG.

On first glance it would seem to have been a strange film (genre) for Peckinpah to tackle, but scratch away at the scabs left by Peckinpah's trademark violence, and you see underneath that it sits comfortably with his character driven Western fables.   Adapting from the much lauded novel by Willi Heinrich, Peckinpah is bleakly telling of men in combat, men who are not here for heroics, they are merely trying to survive, the realities of war draining their last bit of strength by the day.

Sure he cares but his treatment of her borders on the repulsive whilst still managing to get the ribs tickled, Brock worries that her dumbness will do down important business issues socially, so he arranges for the calm and well spoken Paul Verrall to be her chaperon and train her to be eloquent and more astute of the world and its history.  The film then becomes your standard Pygmalion story as the nice but dim Billie not only learns about the world she live",3

Everything leads to the Little 500 bicyclist race at Indiana University.   “Breaking Away” (1979) wisely focuses on the characters rather than bicycling and is comparable to “Dead Poets Society” from a decade later.

I loved Lumet's films he made before this that I've seen--'12 Angry Men', 'The Fugitive Kind', 'The Hill', 'The Anderson Tapes' and 'Murder on the Orient Express'--and he's superb at getting the gradual self-destruction of his characters that just seethes through the screen.  At this point, Pacino could do no wrong in his work--he had that firm grasp on his immense talent and just what he needed from it to do remarkable work, some of the finest characterizations in contemporary cinema. Do both he and yourself a favour and don't bother with anything he's made since 'Heat'. **A good film, but not as memorable as some people say.**  Director",2

The same can be said for the casting of Virginia Mayo as Lady Barbara Wellesley, pretty as she is, it's an odd bit of casting that never quite comes off, yet as daft as it may sound, neither case of miscasting hurts the picture, and this comes down to the astute direction from Raoul Walsh.  The pace never flags so we are never over concerned with the central actors struggles to make the characters work, backed up by Guy Green's camera work and Robert Farnon's jaunty score, the technical aspects of the piece steer the viewer on to safe waters (ahem).

He was one of the finest at getting straight through the bullshit and to the heart of all things noir (as the immortal Jean-Luc Godard stated, 'All I need to make a film is a man, a girl and a gun').   Barbara Stanwyck is one of my favourite actresses of the period, and is a classic 'femme fatale'. I've never been a huge fan of Fred MacMurray, but his 'nice guy' persona is used to sheer advantage by Wilder, and he end up both doing his finest work for Wilder (here and in 'The Apartment') and being the ultimate noir male protagonist. Interestingly, one of my favourite actors, Edward G. Robinson, thought so much of the script that he opted out of his demand of never doing a supporting role. Many people admire Wilder the director, but as a writer (or co-writer) he's just as cinematically important and influential.  ",5

Music is by Maurice Jarre and cinematography by John Alcott.  Already filmed impressively as The Big Clock in 1948, Fearing's ingenious source material gets a shift to a Pentagon backdrop and still comes out a winner. Putting their own spin on the central story, that of a man finding he is investigating ""himself"" during a murder enquiry, the makers unfurl a labyrinthine plot that keeps up the suspense quota right to the very end.  In true noir style, the story is crammed with double bluffs, deceit, sex and death, with the added ingredient of politico intrigue to spice things still further.

Their friendship is about to be severely tested, though, when the former man announced that he has split up with his wife. ""Oscar"" rides to the rescue with an offer for him to move in with him, and what now ensues are a cleverly written, and generally entertaining, series of domestic scenarios in which these two men must learn to cohabit. It's pretty clear from the outset that ""Oscar"" is not exactly house-proud and as the story develops their relationship starts to creak. Neil Simon has created a wonderfully witty, pithy and humorous dialogue which both men deliver with a great deal of natural timing; they immerse themselves in the roles - an unusual narrative for two men - and deliver quite an engaging observation on how these two friends simply cannot cope with each other full time.

It is an epic masterpiece in many ways and it really explains why despite the numerous viewings, Gladiator still amuses me with its powerful imageries and many other crucial aspects so that it won five Academy Awards. This film is very well written, the well-ensemble casts, the A-class acting (especially Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix), the stunning cinematography and definitely a strong character of Maximus (magnificently portrayed by Russell Crowe) whose life, struggle, disappointment and anger really move the audience, as if the world attention centers on him. Gladiator is not a historical film, because it only used the history of the ancient Roman Empire merely as the time setting. All other aspects namely those gorgeous shots, the great storyline/plot, the fantastic cinematography, the vividly lavish colors, detailed production design and digital imaging (that successfully rebuilt the stunning beauty of the ancient Roman Em",5

The soundtrack is phenominal and I could real off quotes all day from the dialouge. ""Any jungle in Guy!!"". This is a must see for anyone who lived though this decade or anyone who didnt experience its true magic. It commits to its schtick and does a great job at nailing it, to be fair.  I did like the opening portion of <em>'Human Traffic'</em> more than what followed it, though even so it's a fun time from beginning to conclusion.

(Operazione Paura) (1966)",Horror,"Colorful Italian Gothic/Horror from Mario Bava  RELEASED IN 1966 and directed by Mario Bava, ""Kill, Baby, Kill"" takes place in a Carpathian village in 1907 where Dr. Paul Eswai (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart) arrives to perform an autopsy at the request of the inspector (Piero Lulli). The evidence points to the hamlet being cursed with a mysterious ghost girl that compels those who see her to kill themselves, which the doctor thinks is rubbish; at first anyway. Erika Blanc plays a visiting medical student who assists Eswai while Fabienne Dali appears as the village witch and Giovanna Galletti as a bitter baroness. Luciano Catenacci is on hand as the burgomaster (mayor) and the witch’s lover.  The movie has a colorful and haunting Gothic/Horror ambiance, which can be traced to earlier films like the B&W ""The City of the Dead"" (aka ""Horror Hotel"") (1960) and, more so, “The Terror” (1963), which was one of Francis Ford Coppola’s early works, although he only directed part of it.

It stars Michael Keaton, Teri Garr and Martin Mull. Music is by Lee Holdridge and cinematography by Victor J. Kemper. Plot sees Keaton as Jack Butler, who after being laid off from work, is forced to become a house husband after his wife Caroline (Garr) lands a good job with Schooner Tuna - something he's really not cut out to do.  Ah, well, look, it's obviously very eighties, and thankfully society has moved on in leaps and bounds since this film was released. But good honest comedy is just that, honest, and for those looking for a good chuckle whilst admiring the talent of a pre-Batman Keaton, Mr. Mom is a bad mood lifter.

Other humans hide in the wilderness, living a primitive life. However, one “man-animal” (Barry Pepper) spurs a movement to free the planet. John Travolta and Forest Whitaker play chief-security Psychlos.  Based on L.

With his half-Caucasian/half-Polynesian girlfriend (Joan Blackman) he tries his hand as a tour guide. Angela Lansbury is on hand as the amusingly snooty mother.      “Blue Hawaii” (1961) was the first and easily the best of three Elvis flicks set in Hawaii, followed by “Girls! Girls!

Actually, it ranks with his better movies, like ""Kid Galahad"" (1962), “Roustabout” (1964) and “Viva Las Vegas"" (1964).   Several things make this one work: The magnificent locations, the trivia about Hawaii & Hawaiians, the compelling story, the serious-but-fun vibe and, of course, the music.

The casting is fine but plain, while the plot is alright if unspectacular and entirely predictable - especially the love story, which is one of the most obvious I think I have ever seen. The humour is decent, probably the best part of this.  James Garner (Costain) and Vera Miles (Henrietta) are a duo once again, following on from their exploits together in <em>'One Little Indian'</em> a year prior. Eric Shea plays Booton, who I feared would be yet another annoying Disney kid actor but he's actually OK all in all.  The villains are extremely forgettable, in fairness Robert Culp (Bryson), Gregory Sierra (Marruja) and Nephi Hannemann (Malakoma) don't get much to work with - unexplored potential; solid actor choices.  This should be far more entertaining, especially as it's an adventure film.

Propelled by talented stars and singers, it's a musical of comedic delights.   Adapted from the successful stage production, charges of being dated and that not all the songs are great, is correct. The dated thing is not always a viable debating tool, but certain stereotype and sexist elements here will ring a little hollow with some folk.   Yet if you can just run with it and accept the era of film making it comes from, then this is mostly a joyous and uplifting picture.

Not sure the kid attempting to be Native American is necessary, either.  I have zero issues with the onscreen talent themselves, James Garner (Clint), Vera Miles (Doris) and Clay O'Brien (Mark), among others, all give fine performances - could've been better, could've been worse.

Barbara Stanwyck plays the owner of the carnival, Joan Freeman the love interest and Pat Buttram a rival in the biz.  “Roustabout” (1964) is easily one of the better Elvis flicks (for me, at least), probably because the setting is the carnival & carnies, but also because the story is serious (rather than farcical) and more captivating than most. Presley’s character, Charlie Rogers, makes for a great protagonist with whom to identify. Meanwhile, the presence of the towering Stanwyck is always compelling, plus Buttram’s character is perfectly suited for him. A plus is the many attractive showgirls in the periphery.  I’d put it on par with ""Kid Galahad"" (1962) and “Viva Las Vegas"" (1964), although the latter is more of a fun farce; “Roustabout” is a serious drama with some musical sequences.  The film runs 1 hour, 41 minutes, and wa",1

The environments remain beautiful, the living creatures may not look quite as superb but are still nice in my opinion. The voice cast are understated yet suitable, much like everything else from the music to the plot.  D. B. Sweeney plays the lead role, portraying a character called Aladar. His voice isn't as strong as I'd want but he does a good job nevertheless. Alfre Woodard stands out slightly as Plio, I recognised her voice instantly having seen her years back on TV's <em>'Desperate Housewives'</em>.  Heftier voices and a more dramatic score would've taken this further in my estimations, though there's no doubting this is a film that has many elements to enjoy.

However, for the second half of the movie it really degrades into a classical John Woo, over the top, action feast with all pretense of intelligence and any true Mission Impossible feel gone. John Woo is not the right person to make a Mission Impossible movie.  As with the first movie if it would not have been labelled Mission Impossible I would probably have given it a higher rating since it is a decent enough, mostly braindead though, Hollywood action movie.

They're pursuing the Empress of China or a load of gold -- whatever -- and have many misadventures.  It didn't dawn on me until the end that the title ""Shanghai Noon"" is a comical take on ""High Noon"" (aduh). Anyway, this is a good flick to watch if you're in the mood for an Indiana Jones-type movie, like 1999's ""The Mummy."" It's not as good as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", but it's better than its sequels.  Chan and Wilson have great chemistry and the humor is amusing, like the Wyatt Earp line at the end.

Here he is far from macho, for sure he will be forced to branch out and defend what's right, but his Tom Craig here is gentile and full of grace, very much a gentleman thank you very much. Plot wise we are treated to standard fare, good guys and bad guys just don't get on, and you just know that some pretty dames are going to have a say in proceedings. Yet this piece really has much more going for it",2

Seton, now ensconced in the ways of the law, sets about crushing Cantrell and his unfeeling raiders, but there is also another matter at hand.

James Braddock, a survivor of a Vietnam Prisoner of War camp who many years later decides to return to find proof - and liberate - American soldiers still being held against their will.  As the 1980s boom for martial artists becoming filmic action stars gathered apace, Chuck Norris carved his own spot upon the testosterone fuelled wave. Much like a lot of films of its ilk, Missing in Action is of course daft, violent, jingoistic but also crucially it's a whole bunch of fun. This naturally comes down to expectation levels for a production of this type, park the brain and enjoy the cheese and carnage. It's a bit disappointing to find that we don't get to see much of Norris' martial artistry, it' s more a case of gun play and standard fists and kicks taking the lead in this one.

You can tell Tarantino was heavily influenced by it because it smacks of his flicks twenty years before he rose to fame with “Pulp Fiction.” It is a combination gangster/road/car flick à la “Bonnie and Clyde” (1967), “Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry” (1974) and “Joyride” (1977).  Someone said that feminists might have a problem with the film because women are generally portrayed as sex objects and little more.

I mean, I grew up in a house that fostered a love for pulp fiction novels, Sabitini, Leonard, Howard, Hammett, and these movies kind of fall right into those novels.  And this had a great cast, Elwes, Silverstone, Rubin, so the film was cast in a way that it could save whatever trash the script was lacking in.  And in this case it's plot turns and mystery that it's lacking. The story itself is honestly pretty boring. And I don't fault anyone that objects to that.  However, it has enough tension to really enjoy it. The acting is great.

3841,Air America (1990),Action|Comedy,"When ""Billy"" (Robert Downey Jr.) loses his pilot's licence after a lively misdemeanour, he finds himself working in war-torn Laos with the team at ""Air America"".

It does move along quickly enough, but the whole thing has a rather comic book feel to it. The writing is poor, the themes repeat themselves once too often and there is little chemistry from anyone on screen as the adventures rather lamely bumble along accompanied by a medicare AOR-style soundtrack.

It has pro-talent and it's always nice to bring the stage into your living room from time to time.

Sadly his peace is short lived because a strong arm cattle baron is determined to drive all the small farmer families off their land, and Shane finds himself drawn into the escalating conflict.  Taken from Jack Schaefer's popular novel, Shane holds up today as one of the most popular revered Westerns because it has mass appeal to the watching public.

Williams High School, a now hot bed integrated school, becomes a beacon of unification via their mixed race football team.  As is normally the case with films of this ilk, it quickly comes to pass that certain artistic licence has been taken with the truth. In reality the issues of race, integration and the near powder-keg atmosphere portrayed in the picture, were long past their worst in Virginia 1971. However, that should in no way detract from the thematics and truthful aspects of this Disney production. As is told in the film, the Titans did have what became known as the perfect season, whilst the bond formed between the black and white members most definitely existed. All told, the film soars high as an inspirational piece, not only for the mixed race community coming together plot's essential being, but in the crucial tale of one Gerry Bertier.  That this film urged me ",4
3917,Hellraiser (1987),Horror,"Hellraiser is probably one of the lesser of the horror franchises from the 80s behind Halloween (yes, I know that came out in 1978), Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street. This is a movie I’ve seen a few times over the years and while it’s hardly a perfect horror film with a clunky set-up, it’s still a lot of fun as the make-up and effects work perhaps is a bit on the cheesy side yet kind of still holds up in a strange way.  The acting is nothing special, though I did like both Clare Higgins and Ashley Laurence, not to mention Doug Bradley in the role of “Lead Cenobite”, who would later be called Pinhead. Kind fascinating that character was accidentally propelled into being a horror icon as he was only a minor part of the film, though based on his design and overall look, not hard to see why he resonated with horror fans.  Hellraiser, written and directed by Clive Barker based on his novella, isn’t a favorite of mine, as mentioned I lean more toward the more reality based sla",1
3918,Hellbound: Hellraiser II (1988),Horror,"Pretty out there (in a good way) sequel that doesn't make a whole lot of sense but still was an entertaining supernatural horror flick, the kind of horror I'm generally not a fan of. Kind of surprising Ashley Laurence didn't go on to bigger things (her last movie was 2008). **3.5/5** ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"" is watchable enough even though it very quickly slides down the steep slope into becoming a messy shambles. It is really nothing more than a tour through the diseased imagination of Clive Barker - it is hard to believe somebody out there actually thought this was a good basis for a film instead of seeking out some description of psychiatric treatment for the poor soul - and its major handicap is that the special effects just aren't up to the challenge of supporting his thoroughly twisted and uniquely original vision. There  is also a desperately heavy reliance on copious amounts of blood and gore just for the hell of it and when you add in the fact that sadly a good portion of it",2

It stars Bud Abbott, Lou Costello, Lon Chaney Junior, Bela Lugosi, Glenn Strange, Lenore Aubert and Jane Randolph. Music is by Frank Skinner and cinematography by Charles Van Enger.  It's well documented come 1948 that Abbott and Costello were becoming victims of changing times and filmic ideas. Coupled with the one time success of the Universal classic monster movies having seemingly had their day, someone at the merged Universal-International head office decided to pit the comic duo with the creature feature legends. Thus a film franchise was born and it helped reignite Bud and Lou's career.  Making the Universal monsters a viable theatre draw once again, this first teaming set a high standard that wasn't to be matched with the following ""meet the monsters"" series.

Maybe it even wants to steal away the women to continue living. That's a scary thought, in and of itself.  When you add that to the movie's best quality, the score, it makes for some truly chilling, truly tense scenes. The whole film is well done, especially for 1954. The set design is fully believable, and the acting is solid all around. Julie Adams specifically does a great job.

This version sees Universal update their own 1925 silent version that starred Lon Chaney, and give it a Technicolor make over whilst practically making it a musical picture. Even making it a light comedy in parts! It is undeniably a gorgeous picture, both visually and aurally, for the sets and operatic tunes alone this could never be called a dull movie.

3938,"Slumber Party Massacre, The (1982)",Horror,"Routine early 80’s slasher in the Los Angeles burbs  The original script was written as a parody, but that was changed when production began and it was shot as a serious slasher. Perhaps this explains why I busted out laughing on at least four occasions. The amusing pizza-eating scene and the refrigerator sequence are good examples. Despite this, “The Slumber Party Massacre” (1981) IS a serious slasher flick featuring the ‘driller killer’ and it’s pretty well-done. The problem is, there’s an unimaginative bluntness to the proceedings and the final act isn’t all that compelling (I found my mind wandering a couple of times).  The female cast is decent, but not quite as good as in the Friday the 13th movies. Diane (Gina Smika Hunter, aka Gina Mari) is arguably the best, followed by the black chick.        The movie is short & sweet at 77 minutes and was shot entirely in Los Angeles with the neighborhood sequences filmed in Venice.   GRADE: C Which one was this?

On a weekend getaway, they venture to a condo outside of town to practice & party with a few invited guys. Unfortunately Courtney is haunted by the past, suffering post-traumatic neurosis marked by a rockabilly driller killer in her nightmares.  “Slumber Party Massacre II” (1987) improves upon the unimaginative bluntness of the first film (1982) with a superior cast of females, highlighted by winsome Bernard and blonde Heidi Kozak as Sally. Juliette Cummins is also on hand as redhead Sheila, who previously appeared in “Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning” (1985) and “Psycho III” (1986).  The film clicks with kinetic mojo and is almost ingenious in the way it dares to sneer at horror conventions for the first two-thirds.

As several guys crash the party someone with a huge drill and murderous intent also invades the proceedings.  ""Slumber Party Massacre III"" (1990) starts out promising, but becomes routine by the midpoint and never recovers, which isn’t helped by increasing tastelessness. While it’s arguably on par with the first film from 1981 (which I slightly prefer), it lacks the impressive creativity of 1987’s part II, which had pizzazz. A marginally more effective slasher with the same plot is the contemporaneous ""Sorority House Massacre II.”  Protagonist Keely Christian (Jackie) stands out in the female cast and looks sublime on the beach, followed by Lulu Wilson (Juliette).

But the production values are subpar by comparison, sparking some to call it the worst 80's slasher film.   It’s true that the movie starts shaky with filmmaking akin to an old soap opera, but it builds some suspense in the second half. And there are a few gems, like when Beth's sorta-date (the short, dark-haired guy) says, ""I just like being with you."" This shows that the writer actually put in some effort despite the Grade B (or Grade C) production values. The fact that there’s no camp and everything plays out deadly seriously is a plus.    The film is short and sweet at 1 hour, 14 minutes; it was shot in Los Angeles.  GRADE: C Which one was this?

Who’s doing the killing since the mass murderer died in the first film?  ""Sorority House Massacre II"" (1990) is less amateurish compared to the first film and adds camp & sexploitation, but only in the sense of female attractiveness and tame nudity, not sex. Speaking of which, this flick is a celebration of the beauty of women masquerading as a slasher.  Some might argue that it degrades women, and I can understand this perspective since some of the protagonists die in the typical slasher manner, but the movie is stressing that they have to rise to the challenge in a life-or-death situation if they want to survive, which smacks of the proverbial girl power.  While the story is overly",2

Michael Caine stars as Jack Carter, a tough no nonsense operator in the London underworld who returns to his home town of Newcastle Upon Tyne when his brother turns up dead.   Directed and adapted to screenplay by Mike Hodges from Ted Lewis' novel ""Jack's Return Home"", Get Carter is a bleakly atmospheric masterwork that takes the period setting of the time and blends harsh realism with film noir sensibilities and filters it through an uncut prism of doom.  Jack Carter as created by Caine and Hodges is the quintessential film noir anti-hero. He smokes French cigarettes and reads Raymond Chandler, there is no hiding the respect and homages to classical noir pulsing away as Jack goes on his not so merry way.

The first half involves droll humor as Greg awkwardly meets his potential parents-in-law and suspects that the father doesn’t like him. Yet this is just a set-up for the wild mishaps of the second half as Murphy’s Law goes into effect.  Teri looks great while Nicole DeHuff is on hand as the sister. Elsewhere, an iconic actor of the period shows up in the second half, but I don’t want to give it away as it’s a welcome surprise (it shouldn’t be too hard to figure out seeing as how this is a Ben Stiller comedy).  The sequel “Meet the Fockers” came out fo",2

Without doubt it's a film, that in spite of its high standing on the main movie sites, polarises opinions. It's a film that in simple terms follows four people through their addictions until the shattering denouement, but the journey is made more bleak by offering tantalising snatches of hope, the dreams of the protags offered up as some sort of goals for the addicts to cling on to - only for the narrative to stick in its rusty serrated blade to draw the lifeblood from the hapless hopefuls.  Arononfsky brings a multitude of technical skills to the party that emphasise the emotional discord on show. Standard split-screening is married up with rapid cutting, isolated framing, close ups, long tracking and Snorricam, all of which is sound tracked by Clint Mansell's haunting musical composition.

Oscar-nominated Allen is good as the feisty, intelligent, senator but the rest of this is all rather lacklustre and frequently overly contrived, with plenty of dramatic events designed to enhance the plot rather then create any sense of plausibility.
